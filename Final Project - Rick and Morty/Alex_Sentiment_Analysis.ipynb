Any idea what that is down there?,That\\'s right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that\\'s what I\\'m talking about, Morty. That\\'s where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you\\'re so in love with school.,You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.,Just take these shoes, Morty. They\\'re  special grappling shoes. When you\\'re wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.,You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!,Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.,Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you\\'ll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?,Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.,Don\\'t worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?,Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.,There\\'s just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it\\'s got no charge left, Morty. It\\'s got no charge left.,It\\'s as good as garbage, Morty. It\\'s not gonna work anymore, Morty.,There\\'s ways to get back home, Morty. It\\'s just it\\'s just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We\\'re gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you\\'re gonna have to do me a real solid.,When we get to customs, I\\'m gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I\\'m gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.,Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.,Well, somebody\\'s got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren\\'t gonna get through customs unless they\\'re in someone\\'s rectum, Morty,And they\\'ll fall right out of mine. I\\'ve done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you\\'re young. Y-y-you\\'ve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you\\'ve got to put these seeds inside your butt.,Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.,I don\\'t like it here, Morty. I can\\'t abide bureaucracy. I don\\'t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?,That means they\\'re good ones. You\\'re a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You\\'ve been a huge help to me. I\\'m gonna be able to do a-,Why does he have to go over there?,What new-  what new machine?,Run, Morty! Run!,Don\\'t think about it!,Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.,I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.,They\\'re just robots, Morty! It\\'s okay to shoot them! They\\'re robots!,It\\'s a figure of speech, Morty. They\\'re bureaucrats. I don\\'t respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!,Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!,You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.,Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It\\'s beyond your reasoning.,Takes one to know one.,What what are you guys doing with my stuff?,A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I\\'m a genius. I build robots for fun.,What are you trying to say about Morty? That he\\'s stupid or something?,I-I-I don\\'t know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?,Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.,The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!,Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.,I told the both of you school is stupid. It\\'s not how you learn things. Morty\\'s a gifted child. He has a special mind. That\\'s why he\\'s my little helper. He\\'s like me. He\\'s gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He\\'s too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.,Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it\\'s gonna be clear communication.,No idea what you\\'re talking about.,Full disclosure, Morty it\\'s not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.,Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you\\'re gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you\\'re also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.,I\\'m sorry, Morty. It\\'s a bummer. In reality, you\\'re as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we\\'re gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we\\'re gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you\\'re gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don\\'t understand what\\'s important, and they\\'ll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I\\'m gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you\\'re gonna be part of them, and together, we\\'re gonna run around, Morty. We\\'re gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We\\'re the only friends we\\'ve got, Morty. It\\'s just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty\\'s things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.,Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.,I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn\\'t pull that thread. Come on, Morty.,Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.,All right, Ruffles What\\'s his name?,Snuffles, shake.,Roll over.,Go to the bathroom.,Yeah, you\\'re at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.,Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you\\'re you\\'re really going to flip your lid over this one.,It\\'s a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people\\'s dreams, Morty. It\\'s just like that movie that you keep crowing about.,That\\'s right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it\\'s gonna may--be make sense.,You don\\'t have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we\\'re gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we\\'re gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A\\'s in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you\\'re gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.,Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.,Come on, let\\'s just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we\\'re gonna incept your teacher. You\\'re frustrating me.,Uh-oh! Spoilers!,I\\'m a full season behind.,It\\'s about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.,All right, Morty, time to make our move.,Allahu  akbar! We\\'re gonna take control of this plane! We\\'re gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!,Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!,Take cover, Morty!,Goldenfold\\'s got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn\\'t take him for an active dreamer. We\\'ve got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can\\'t get killed. If you get killed in someone else\\'s dream, you die for real, Morty.,Don\\'t be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we\\'ll be fine!,Goldenfold, we\\'re coming out! We just want to talk!,Because we\\'re both rational adults that don\\'t want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.,Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!,Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!,Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we\\'ve merely prolonged the inevitable. That\\'s it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes\\' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That\\'ll buy us some time to figure this out!,All right, let\\'s go.,Don\\'t judge, Morty.,Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we\\'re gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I\\'ll talk to you after lunch.,Whoa, whoa, whoa! What\\'s the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You\\'re kind of killing the vibe in here.,Time to go another dream deep, Morty!,Geez, I don\\'t know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?,Oh, here we go!,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an \\'80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.,Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else\\'s dreams, Morty!,The little girl!,Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we\\'ve hit dream bedrock here, Morty.,Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We\\'re so screwed!,What are we here for again? Incepting? We\\'re trying to incept-,Oh, yeah.,Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.,Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy\\'s advice on anything?,Worst-case scenario we\\'re back to running.,Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it\\'s nice to be on the same page every once in a while.,Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He\\'s getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That\\'s when we make our move.,Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we\\'ll incept him.,Looks like scary Terry\\'s having a nightmare.,Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don\\'t you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?,You\\'re putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you\\'re perfectly scary enough as it is.,You\\'re our boy, dawg. Don\\'t even trip.,As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.,Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?,Well, it\\'s possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity\\'s cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.,Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.,It\\'s all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?,Ooh, great plan, Jerry.,No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing\\'s gonna be over really soon.,It\\'s a dream, Morty. We\\'re in your dog\\'s dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles\\' dream.,It\\'s been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It\\'s like \"Inception,\" Morty, so if it\\'s confusing and stupid, then so is everyone\\'s favorite movie.,No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You\\'re sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it\\'s a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.,Look, d-d-d-don\\'t worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.,Close. It\\'s gonna make your kidneys shut down.,It\\'s necessary for the plan, Morty. Don\\'t even trip, dawg.,I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I\\'d watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they\\'ll do it board-driven.,What do you know, Morty? What do you know?,Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.,I should get her pregnant, then she\\'ll have to marry me.,Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I\\'m not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.,Jerry, it\\'s your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.,Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call \"love\" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.,Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I\\'m almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It\\'s gonna be great.,Morty, that\\'s such a poor use of my time, it\\'s beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.,You\\'re growing up fast, Morty. You\\'re growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?,It\\'s a, it\\'s a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal\\'s brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.,A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn\\'t Game Of Thrones.,Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?,Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it\\'s full proof.,Ugh, unless she has the flu.,Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let\\'s get this dumb universe rolling. Let\\'s do this thing.,Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world\\'s time is gonna be fine, but our time\\'s gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.,It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don\\'t touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.,And away we go!,Shhh, Morty!,Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you\\'re at. Hi, sweety.,Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don\\'t you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here\\'s five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I\\'m just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.,Uh oh.,Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what\\'s going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father\\'s children. Think for yourselves, don\\'t be sheep.,Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you\\'re falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!,Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank\\'s money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?,Huh, what do you know, it\\'s working,Oh shit.,Yes, we\\'re back, problem solved.,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They\\'re really embarassing.,I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don\\'t exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there\\'s a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!,What if I told you there\\'s a huge ticket up right behind you?,Alright, hear me out on this. You\\'re immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there\\'s 100% chance that you\\'ll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.,Ah, God, gross and weird!,Summer, Morty, take off your collars!,Good question. I suppose the answer is,You know what I\\'m talking about, oh yeah. I\\'m gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I\\'m doing the cabbage patch dance. It\\'s a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.,Yeah.,Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.,No it doesn\\'t. It hurts.,Uh, w-why don\\'t you get it Jerry? you\\'re the man of the house and you don\\'t have a job.,Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth\\'s handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has \\'squanch,\\' in it a lot. Doesn\\'t that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?,Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what\\'s in your squanch and people understand.,Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.,The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.,Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.,Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!,My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.,I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.,No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.,You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.,Good luck, Mr. President.,I dabble, Mr. President.,Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?,Yeah, not with that attitude.,All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?,Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty,Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops,Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here,Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today,I think planet Earth has just been transported.,Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.,Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.,Genius happens in the moment, Morty.,That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.,Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?,Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.,Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…,Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!,Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!,Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.,Nooooo!,Ahhhh, shit!,Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.,Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or…\\xa0?,Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.,What? Why not?,What the fuck? You can turn into ice?,Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.,Ahem.

Well this won\\'t do.,A sequel.,Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.,You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you.

Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?,Hey, what\\'s wrong Morty? Oh, you\\'re worried about your dad, huh?,Morty let\\'s-let\\'s see what else is on.,Oh, man Morty.

You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?,\\' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you\\'re aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?,Yeah, well, tough titties.,Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.,The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.,Fine, but I\\'m driving.,To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.,Yeah, I\\'d like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you\\'re allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film \"Mulan,\" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it\\'s delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it\\'s gone. This is the only place we\\'re gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.,Okay. All right, all right.,Me. I used to wear blue pants.,I didn\\'t. I did.,Yeah. That\\'s the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.,Nope, they cannot.,Because the code you just uploaded wasn\\'t actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.,True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.,Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.,Okay, have fun in what\\'s left of my brain. I\\'m gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there\\'s not enough room for all my genius, so I\\'m leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.,Duh!,Morty, take this. You\\'re gonna need it later.,What -- What\\'s this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You\\'re trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar\\'s Palace here.,I came to kill you, bro. That\\'s not even my original Summer.,20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I\\'m encouraging you to do.,Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.,Because it\\'s incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I\\'m super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.,Not an issue, sweetie.,Morty, I know you\\'re too stupid to get this, but you\\'re really fuckin\\' this up right now.,I wasn\\'t gonna let her die, you fuckin\\' moron!,The point is he thought I was going to.,You\\'re a serious fuckin\\' idiot, Morty!

It\\'s insane what you miss in prison.,No, you\\'re right. Where\\'s the vodka?,Seems like you guys need some privacy. I\\'ll, uh -- I\\'ll be in the garage.,What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man\\'s garage is his castle.,Oh, I-I\\'m sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.,For everybody.,Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We\\'ve got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.,Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that\\'s different -- no more Dad, Morty.,He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.,I\\'ve replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn\\'t have accepted me if I came home -,- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -,- or sister I said any of this, I\\'ll deny it -,- and they\\'ll take my side because I\\'m a hero, Morty. And now you\\'re gonna have to go -,- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I\\'ll -- I\\'ll go out and I\\'ll find some more of that \"Mulan\" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -,- Because that\\'s -- that\\'s what this is all about, Morty.,That\\'s my one-armed man! I\\'m not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I\\'m driven by finding that McNugget sauce.,I want that \"Mulan\" McNugget sauce, Morty! That\\'s my series arc, Morty.,If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.,That\\'s what\\'s gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.,Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.,For 97 more years, Morty!,I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!,Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.,Absolutely.,Yeah, either one.
