The Abandoned [[Jerry Smith|Jerrys]] are a group of Jerrys who reside in the [[Jerryboree]] because their Ricks and Mortys never returned to pick them up. They live in a backroom, away from the Jerrys who only stay at Jerryboree temporarily.

==History==
They were placed in the daycare centre by their respective Ricks and Mortys so they could go on adventures unencumbered. However, the Ricks and Mortys of the Abandoned Jerrys never returned, leaving the Jerrys stranded in the daycare centre.

==Biography==
They received a new temporary member in [[Jerry Smith]], with whom they played cards. He came up with an idea to escape the daycare, to which they stated that no one in [[Jerryboree]] is kept against their will. When Jerry asked them why they chose to remain in the daycare, they answered with the same reason he himself was still there; because "they're Jerrys", coupled with the fact that the world outside the building is comparatively unknown and potentially hostile.

==Trivia==
*Due to the dangerous nature of Rick and Mortys adventures, the ones belonging to these abandoned Jerrys are most likely dead.
