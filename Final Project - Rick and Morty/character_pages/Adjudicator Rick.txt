{{Quote|The number of displaced Mortys is soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider. Solve that one real quick.|{{PAGENAME}} to Candidate Morty}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was the adjudicator at the first presidential debate at [[The Citadel]].

==Appearance==
{{PAGENAME}} had combed grey-blue hair and unibrow. He was tall and lanky, like most Ricks, with bags under his eyes. He wore a navy blue suit with a red and maroon striped tie, and a light blue shirt.

==Biography==
{{PAGENAME}} along with other [[Rick]]s in the crowd were judging the candidates for the next President of [[The Citadel]]. It was shown that he didn't take [[President Morty]] very seriously and neither did the other candidates. He mocked Candidate Morty while asking his question, to the entertainment of both the Rick audience and the Rick candidates. His reaction after Candidate Morty's answer is not known, but presumed to be equal to that of the other candidates, who did not join the audience in cheering.

His disrespect towards Candidate Morty would soon come back to bite him when Candidate Morty became President Morty. After seizing control of The Citadel, the new president ordered the arrest and assassination of a number of Ricks and Mortys he felt wronged by. {{PAGENAME}} was one of them, and he was soon arrested and/or killed by the Guard Ricks. His lifeless body was later dumped into space along with a great amount of other dead Ricks and Mortys. 

==Trivia==
*{{PAGENAME}} is based on [[wikipedia:Anderson Cooper|Anderson Cooper]], who co-moderated the second 2016 presidential debate.
