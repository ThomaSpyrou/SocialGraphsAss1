'''Amfiddians''' are large, 3-eyed, fish-like beings that hail from the planet [[Amfiddia]].

==Appearance==
Amfiddians have a distinct fish-like appearance with a notable dorsal fin on the back of their head, three eyes, short height, and fin-like hands and feet. They have scaly skin, mainly seen in murky green and red color. They wear both pants and jackets/vests, but not shoes. 

==History==
An Amfiddian was playing an arcade game at [[Blips and Chitz]] while [[Morty]] was playing [[Roy: A Life Well Lived]], in "[[Mortynight Run]]". 

Two Amfiddians was later seen at the wedding of [[Birdperson]] and [[Tammy]] on [[Planet Squanch]] in "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]". It's not known if they escaped or were shot by the [[Galactic Federation]].
