'''Amish Cyborg''' was a fake persona taken by an [[Alien Parasites|Alien Parasite]]. He appeared in the episode [[Total Rickall|''Total Rickall'']]. He was shot and killed by Rick while fleeing from him in the kitchen.

==Appearance==
Amish Cyborg is an old, Amish man with a big black beard and sideburns who wears a black hat, a white shirt, brown jeans, held up by suspenders, and black shoes. He has one robotic leg and an arm, the latter having the head of a shovel at the end. Half of his face is also robotic, with two red circular lights in the place of his eye, and a robotic cover over his mouth, with green lights on it that go up and down when he talks. He is often referred to as Hamborg by his close friend [[Hamurai]].

==Personality==
A silly and nonsensical character. In his case, making an Amish man into a cyborg, when the Amish are a community known for refusing the conveniences of modern technology, is essentially an oxymoron in itself.

== Trivia ==
* He is the only strange silly character to not instantly turn into a Parasite onscreen.
