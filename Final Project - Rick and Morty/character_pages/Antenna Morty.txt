}}'''Antenna Morty''' is an alternate version of [[Morty]] with two green antennaes on his head.

==Biohgraphy==
He was one of the slaves captured by [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty|Morty]] and held in their base on [[Hideout Planet]]. He ultimately teamed up with the other Mortys to take down the Rick and his [[Crab Spider]]s. His dream is "to write really crazy, intense action novels". Afterwards, he was escorted back to [[The Citadel]] with the rest of the stolen Mortys.

He later attended one of [[President Morty]]'s speeches, as seen in "[[Tales From the Citadel]]", in front of a Morty statue. 
==Appearance==
Antenna Morty is a young Caucasian teenage boy with short brown hair and a yellow shirt. He looks identical to most Mortys, except that he has two green alien-like antennae on his head.
