'''Antenna Rick''' is an alternate version of [[Rick Sanchez]] who has two green antennas on his head.

==Biography==
Antenna Rick was one of the few thousand Ricks who banded together to make [[The Citadel|The Citadel of Ricks]]. He was a frequent visitor at the Citadel and on one visit he was witness to the trial of [[Rick C-137]] before the [[Council of Ricks]]. He was shocked when the Council revealed that [[The Scientist Formerly Known as Rick]] was one of the murder victims, like all other Ricks present. 

In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", many Ricks are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] was transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Antenna Rick is one of the Ricks who died.

==Appearance==
{{PAGENAME}} is a four-armed, long-eared, three-eyed version of Rick. His green antennas clash with the otherwise ash-grey color of his skin. He dresses like most other Ricks and has the same hair color and style.

==Trivia==
*It is possible that this is just [[Alien Rick]] colored wrong, seeing as their only difference is their skin colors.
