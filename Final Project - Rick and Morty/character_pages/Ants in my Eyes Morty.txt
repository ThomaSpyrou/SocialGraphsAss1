'''Ants in my Eyes Morty''' is a Morty that was owned by '''Rick Sanchez (C-594)'''. He was accidently killed by [[Morty Smith (C-594)]] when the other Morty ripped out Ants in my Eyes Morty's [[Morty Manipulator Chip]]. Just like [[Ants in my Eyes Johnson]], he couldn't see on account of the ants in his eyes, and he also couldn't feel.
