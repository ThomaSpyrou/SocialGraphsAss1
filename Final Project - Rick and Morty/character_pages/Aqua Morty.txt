}}'''Aqua Morty''' is an alternate version of [[Morty Smith]] who often would be at [[The Citadel]] with [[Aqua Rick|his Rick]].

==Appearance==
Aqua Morty shares the general appearance of [[Morty Smith]], though with many distinguishable features usually acquainted with that of a sea creature. Like [[Fish Rick]], he wears a helmet, presumably filled with water.

==Biography==
{{PAGENAME}} came to The Citadel with his Rick at the same time as the trial of [[Rick C-137]], and watched them be escorted to the council chambers before joining the audience for the trial. He also watched as C-137 Rick and Morty escaped from the Citadel.

He was again at The Citadel when Morty and [[Summer]] were escorted to the Council to inform them of the capture of their Rick. Soon after, the Citadel was teleported into a [[Galactic Federation Prison]] and fighting broke out. It's not known if {{PAGENAME}} survived this event.
