==Biography==
[[File:S1e10 fishman morty.png|thumb|{{PAGENAME}} and Morty seeing C-137 Rick and Morty]]
{{PAGENAME}} was one of many many Ricks who banded together to create the Citadel due to many enemies who wanted him dead. He would often bring his Morty along to the Citadel, including the time when [[Rick]] and [[Morty]] of [[Dimension C-137]] were arrested and brought to the Citadel to stand trial. {{PAGENAME}} and his Morty was standing around on the upper levels of the Citadel was passed by the arrested Rick and Morty escorted by [[Guard Rick]]s. They soon joined in the audience at the trial before C-137 Rick and Morty escaped.

He and his Morty was present at the Citadel during the events of the [[Galactic Federation#Fall|fall of the Galactic Federation]] and the [[The Rickshank Rickdemption|destruction of the Citadel]] by Rick C-137. The two aquatic humanoids were walking past the escorted Morty and [[Summer]], who were on their way to the Council of Ricks. {{PAGENAME}} would go on to survive the catastrophic event and help rebuild the Citadel.

During the first presidential election on the Citadel, he had become just another Rick in the crowd who went to work and did their job. He showed up to [[Evil Morty|Candidate Morty]]'s public appearance outside the "''Hard Rick Café''" to show his support for the presidential candidate. He was presumably shocked when Candidate Morty was shot by [[Campaign Manager Morty]] in the middle of the crowd. He would later go on to vote for Candidate Morty in the election and bring upon the great change for the Citadel.
