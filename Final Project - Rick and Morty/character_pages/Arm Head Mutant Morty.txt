==Biography==
{{PAGENAME}} was tasked with protecting one of [[The Citadel]]'s entrances when it was grounded, along with other mutant Mortys. [[Morty Smith (C-594)|Morty C-594]] and [[Rick Sanchez (C-594)|Rick C-594]] encountered the group of mutants on their way to the [[Council of Ricks]]. When his fight with Morty C-594 began, Morty C-594 threw a rock at his mutated opponent, but {{PAGENAME}} caught the rock with his third arm. Out of ideas on how to defeat him, Morty C-594 asked Rick for help, who merely shot {{PAGENAME}} with a stun gun.
