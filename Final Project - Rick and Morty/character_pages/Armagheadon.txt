}}'''Armagheadon''' is a [[Cromulons|Cromulon]] that appeared in the episode [[Get Schwifty]].

==Biography==
He is a giant apocalyptic head that confronted the people of [[Earth]], trying to get them to make a hit song for them and then put them on his show, [[Planet Music]]. The majority of people in the town (led by [[Principal Vagina]]) misinterpreted him as a god and started the religion of [[Headism]] to worship him. Over the course of Planet Music, he told contestants to play and announced when they were disqualified. He decided to end the show after 988 seasons and declared Earth the final winner before teleporting the planet back into its place in the Solar System.

==Trivia==
*His name is a portmanteau on "armageddon" and "head".
