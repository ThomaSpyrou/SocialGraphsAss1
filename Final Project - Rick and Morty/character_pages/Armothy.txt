'''Armothy''' is the name [[Morty Smith]] gave an arm which previously contained the life of an inhabitant from the [[Post-Apocalyptic Dimension]] Armothy came up in the [[season 3]] episode [[Rickmancing the Stone|Rickmancing the Stone.]] In his previous life, Armothy used to be a woodcutter in a small village, which was then pillaged by invaders. These invaders then burned his wife and children and tortured him, causing him to seek revenge through murder. Armothy's fate, whether by the invaders or eventual death by the [[Death Stalkers]], is unknown, but his arm eventually ended up hung out to dry in the back of a car, presumably fated to be eaten. The rest of Armothy's body is never seen. [[File:S3E2 Rick removing Armthony's Physique.png|thumb|170x170px]] Armothy became a part of Morty when [[Rick Sanchez]] transferred Armothy's physique and muscle memory into [[Morty |Morty's]] arm to distract other inhabitants by fighting in the Blood Dome (or the Thunder Dome), whilst attempting to steal a large deposit of Isotope-322. The arm moved and "thought" independently from the rest of Morty. Though [[Morty]] was at first horrified, he soon used Armothy to vent his frustration toward his father [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] for agreeing to divorce [[Beth Smith|Beth]]. Eventually, Armothy found the leader of the invaders who ordered the attack on his village. [[Morty]], realizing that once Armothy's revenge was carried out he would disappear, tried to get Armothy to delay revenge so [[Morty]] could continue to vent his frustrations. However, after deciding they both needed to move on, the two bid their goodbyes before Armothy apparently choked the leader to death and Morty's arm reverted to normal.

A few seconds later, it turned out he failed to judge whether the leader was dead before "moving on." Once the target started to come to, [[Rick]] held Morty's hand and the two finished the job in choking him. Rick then said, "See [[Morty]]? Now we're ''both'' accountable."
