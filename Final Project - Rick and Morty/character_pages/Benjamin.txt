}}'''Benjamin''' is one of the main protagonists of ''[[Ball Fondlers]]'', and a recurring character in ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]]''. He films the group's adventures.

==Appearance==
Benjamin is a midget who wears an orange shirt and headphones. He rarely moves and has a disturbing derpy face, due to him being astonished by the feats of the other [[Ball Fondlers]].

His incredibly short arms may be a reference to the original concept of ''Ball Fondlers'', in which the group resembled the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and existed in a world where people's arms were too short to fondle their own junk, hence their name.
