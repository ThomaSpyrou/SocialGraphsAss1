'''Beta-Seven''' is a Hivemind who has a planet near [[Unity's Planet]] and trades with [[Unity]] as part of an alliance. Beta-Seven seems to want be seen as more than an "ally" to Unity; when Beta-Seven first meets [[Rick]], it appears to be jealous of his relationship with Unity, and begins stammering when Unity confronts it about screeching at Rick.

It is suggested that after Rick and Unity break up again. Rick grew depressed, and tried to kill himself. Beta-Seven now may have a closer relationship with Unity. In a post-credits scene Beta-Seven prevents Rick from seeing Unity, saying that Rick is classified as a hostile entity, and that Unity does not wish to speak with him.
