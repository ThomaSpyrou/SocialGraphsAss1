The '''Big Boobed Waitress''' is an unnamed waitress from another dimension, who appeared in the episode [[Meeseeks and Destroy]]. She served [[Rick]] and [[Morty]] their food and was confronted by [[Mr. Booby Buyer]], attempting to buy her boobs from her, which she nicely declined to. She mentioned that she spent 25 [[Schmeckle]]s on her big fake boobies.
