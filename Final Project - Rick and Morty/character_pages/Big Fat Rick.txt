'''Big Fat Rick''' is one of the alternate versions of [[Rick Sanchez]] who appears in "[[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]]".
== Biography ==
He, along with other versions of the Smith family, was invited by Rick C-137 on a cook-off to discuss the repairment of their GoTrons.

== Appearance ==
Big Fat Rick is, as his name implies, an overweight old man who wears a black tuxedo, a red jacket with a white shirt and a black tie underneath, and black jeans. He also has a small mustache and wears two golden rings on his left hand's index and fore fingers.

== Trivia ==
*Big Fat Rick is likely a parody of the Mafia Don Vito Corleone from ''The Godfather'' as their vocal cadence, mannerisms, and confidence appear to mirror Marlon Brando's performance from the film.
