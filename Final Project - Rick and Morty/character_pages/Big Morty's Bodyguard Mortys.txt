'''Big Morty's Bodyguard Mortys''' are two characters who appeared in "[[Tales From the Citadel]]". They were killed by [[Cop Rick]] and [[Cop Morty]].

==Biography==
Both Bodyguard Mortys are visible on two sides of the front of the room [[Big Morty]] is in. The Morty in the tank top is on the left side and the Morty with the vest is on the right. The Tank Top Morty gives Cop Rick an envelope with money in it. Later, the Big Morty, Cop Rick, and Cop Morty are asked by the two Bodyguard Mortys, "Which Morty?" two separate times. The first time Cop Rick responds with "my partner." The second time they ask it Big Morty responds with "The Cop, morons."

After Cop Rick refuses to take the money the two Bodyguard Mortys grab their guns, Cop Morty punches the Tank Top Morty first before also attacking the Vest Morty. A shoot-out occurs, where Cop Morty shoots Vest Morty in the face, killing him instantly. Cop Rick shoots the Tank Top Morty in the face as well also killing him.

==Appearance==
Both Mortys are slightly taller and more muscular than regular Mortys. One of the bodyguards has a tank top and track pants, while the other has a tank top and a jacket with tight pants. They both carry a gun concealed in their pants and jacket, respectively.
