Not much is known about her, other than that she was captured by the [[Galactic Federation]] and put in prison because she was the daughter of Birdperson, a wanted terrorist. She appears in the post-credits scene of "[[Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort]]" wherein another prison inmate picks on her before shoving her food on the floor. Birdperson's daughter then beats up the inmate before being dragged away by two [[Gromflomites]].
