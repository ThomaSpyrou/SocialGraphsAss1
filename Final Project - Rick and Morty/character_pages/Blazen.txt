== Biography ==
The original Blazen presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

Blazen is first shown to be meditating on a plane full of US Marines. [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] bet that he will survive the longest and admire him. When Morty finds [[Sticky]], Blazen states that he knows what is happening, before revealing that he was joking and that what was happening was totally random. Blazen then leads Rick and Morty into a cave that contains semen before coming face to face with monster sperm. He then unsheathes his sword but gets it stuck in the cave roof. He attempts to jump for the sword but his pants fall off revealing that he is wearing [[Kathy Ireland|his wife's]] thong. The sword dislodges from the cave roof impaling Blazen. His dying wish is to tell his wife that he wasn't wearing her thong and attempts to have sex with himself before he is devoured by the monster sperm.
