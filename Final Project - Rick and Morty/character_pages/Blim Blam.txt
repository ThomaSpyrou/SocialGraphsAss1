'''Blim Blam''' is a [[Korblocks|Korblock]] murderer who eats babies, and apparently traveled to Earth to do so. He was eventually captured and chained up by [[Rick]] in an attempt to cure Blim Blam's "space AIDS" in order to become rich selling the cure. He was discovered by [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]], however, and the two's bickering annoyed Blim Blam to the point that he broke free, berated the two by using a translation device Rick had (as he could only speak in alien beforehand), and then left promising never to return to Earth.

==Trivia==
*Blim Blam's race is biologically incapable of laughter.
*He was originally dubbed 'Gagoo' by [[Summer Smith|Summer]] to threaten [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] by telling Beth and Jerry about his existence in the secret underground basement. This was whilst her, [[Morty Smith|Morty]] and Rick were on [[Unity's Planet]].
*Furthermore, in the Season 3 episode "[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]", Rick mentions "I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week", to which we can assume he was referencing the Korblock species.
