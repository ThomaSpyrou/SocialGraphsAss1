'''Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick''' is a Rick that appears in the episode "[[Tales From the Citadel]]", in which he attempts to make a Portal Gun for the [[Mortytown Locos]].

==Biography==
As three [[Mortytown Locos]] and Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick watch [[President Morty|President Morty's]] speech, one of the Mortytown Locos asks Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick "when there's a Morty president, are you gonna lick my balls or what?". Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick answers with "Grandson, you keep me peeling scraps qualms and slipping Nib Nibs, I'll lick whatever ain't nailed down". Suddenly [[Cop Rick]] and [[Cop Morty]] burst into the room, which quickly prompts the Mortytown Locos to raise their hands in the air. Cop Morty then say that the fluid their Rick is using is bootleg portal fluid. Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick attempts to escape, but due to the Bootleg portal gun not being done or tested properly, once Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick touches the portal it kills him instantly.
