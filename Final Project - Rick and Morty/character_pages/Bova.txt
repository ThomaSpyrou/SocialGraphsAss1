'''Bova''' is a character who appeared in "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]".

==Biography==
She and her husband [[Hoovy]] lived in a cottage within a forest of the planet in the [[Narnia Dimension]], where time moved much faster compared to the [[Replacement dimension|Replacement Dimension]]. [[Rick Sanchez]] would use this passage of time to quickly age alcohol by decades.

With Hoovy, she conceived a son named [[Japheth]], who was born during Hoovy's travel to the [[Earth]] of the [[Replacement dimension]], leading the two to believe he had abandoned them. Eventually, she passed away and her corpse remained sitting upright in a rocking chair inside the cottage for years.

==Trivia==
* Her name seems to be a reference to the eponymous Marvel Comics character, who is also a humanoid cow.
* Bova's death and reveal is likely a reference to Norma Louise Bates from Alfred Hitchcock's horror classic ''Psycho'', who also was denied proper burial and left decaying in a wooden chair.
