The '''Bullies''' are three students at [[Harry Herpson High School]]. They appear in ''[[Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat]]'', with one of them having previously appeared in the ending credits of ''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]''.

==Biography==
One student at Harry Herpson High School bullied a young child at a playground and was beaten up by Rick and Summer, as a result of his actions.

When [[Morty]] was stopped by The Ginger Bully in the school hallway, The Ginger Bully made numerous threats in regard to his nonchalant attitude, all of which were ignored due to Morty's overconfidence brought on by the death crystal in his possession. After touching The Ginger Bully's face, he smashed his head into a locker then promised that Morty would die the following day. Both The Ginger Bully and his friends were present when Morty arrives with weaponry he took from [[The Garage]] the next day. After briefly taunting Morty, The Ginger Bully took a swing with a chain but missed and was carried up into the atmosphere in several seconds. The other bullies attacked Morty, but one was gummed and the other was sucked into a very small box, which Morty then picked up and stored.

==Appearance==
The bullies are average-sized teenagers. The lead bully and one of his friends has red-orange hair, while the third has brown hair. All three wear a t-shirt and pants, while two of the three have the pants tucked into boots.
