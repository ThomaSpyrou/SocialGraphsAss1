'''Canklanker Thom''' was a [[Gromflomite]] veteran who served in the [[Galactic Federation]]'s military during [[Glapflap#Battle of Blood Ridge|the revolt]] 27 [[Glaagnar|glaagnars]] ago. He later started working at a [[Galactic Federation Prison]], and after the [[Galactic Federation#Fall|Galactic Federation's fall]], ingested his cyanide pill.

==Biography==
Thom served in the Galactic Federation Gromflomite forces at the [[Glapflap#Battle of Blood Ridge|Battle of Blood Ridge]]. On their last surge to eliminate the rebels, he got separated from his platoon when his legs were crushed by a HoverGORD. After lying there for several days, he was found by [[Rick Sanchez]] who, albeit unintentionally, saved Canklanker by defecating on his face. This kept Thom alive until he was found a few days later by a medic team.[http://fedconnect.galacticfederation.com/post/155973862723/gromflomite-veterans-reflect-on-blood-ridge]

At some point, he started working at the Galactic Federation Prison where Rick Sanchez would later be incarcerated. Following the transportation of the [[Citadel of Ricks]] into the Galactic Prison, and the beginning of the [[Blemflarck#Blemflarck Crisis|Blemflarck crisis]], Thom decided to ingest his standard-provided cyanide pill and died.[http://fedconnect.galacticfederation.com/profile?id=g-6060842]
