'''Chris''' is the president of the Microverse. He appeared in the episode [[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]], and is voiced by Alan Tudyk. Chris is the head of the society that powers Rick's car, using an invention called the Gooble Box that he gave them. On a previous occasion when Rick visited the Microverse, Rick met Chris and told him that "fuck you" means "much obliged". However, Chris would later allow [[Zeep Zanflorp]] to make an invention that would make Rick's <span style="font-weight:normal;">Gooble Box </span>obsolete, oblivious to the fact that this would mean the end of Rick's car battery life. He, and the rest of his species, appear to be very gullible, due to falling for Rick's "Translations" of words, such as 'Fuck You' meaning 'Much Obliged' and the Middle Finger meaning 'Peace among Worlds'. He also appears oblivious to the fact that his entire universe exists within a battery, with his species being the power source.
