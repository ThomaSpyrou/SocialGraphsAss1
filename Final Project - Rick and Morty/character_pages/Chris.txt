'''Chris''' is an alien weapon that was used by [[Shleemypants]] in the episode "[[A Rickle in Time]]". He is a live, slug-like alien that is used as a weapon and considered the equivalent of a gun to Shleemypants.

==Biography==
In the episode "[[A Rickle in Time]]", Shleemypants pulled Chris out of his pocket and wielded it as a weapon against Rick and his family. He threatened to use it on him until Rick distracted and disarmed Shleemypants. Rick attempted to use Chris against his owner, but found the gun "gross and weird" and simply tossed him into the street, where he was run over by a car and killed, much to the dismay of Shleemypants.

==Trivia==
*According to his owner, Chris can transform a target into a third trimester fetus at thirty yards.
