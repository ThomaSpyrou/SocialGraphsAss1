}}'''Balik Alistane''' or '''Coach Feratu''' is an unseen character that was mentioned in the episode ''[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]''. He was a [[Vampire]] who was employed as a gym teacher at [[Harry Herpson High School]].

The name "Feratu" was an alias he used while being around humans. His real vampire name was '''Balik Alistane'''.

==History==
Coach Feratu's vampiric activities first came to light when one of the school's lunch ladies was found dead in the gym with symptoms of a vampire attack. After finding out that vampires do exist, [[Summer]] asks [[Rick]] if he could turn himself into a teenager, come to the school, and help hunt the vampire down. Rick berates Summer for suggesting the idea, but later does it anyway when he turns himself into [[Tiny Rick]].

Tiny Rick, Summer, and [[Morty]] eventually end up killing Coach Feratu by the end of the day.

Later, upon hearing the news of Coach Feratu's death, the [[Vampire Master]] was more shocked that Coach Feratu would name himself after a famous vampire movie and wrote it off as a lame joke, and decreed that any alias used would be real names from then on.

==Trivia==
* Coach Feratu's last name is taken from the word Nosferatu, which basically means vampire, and was first popularized in works such as Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ''Dracula'' and the 1922 film ''Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror''.
