==Biography==
After [[Rick Sanchez]] escaped from the [[Galactic Federation]] Prison in the body of [[Rick Sanchez (D-99)|Rick D-99]] in a spaceship, he calls in to the communicators at the Citadel of Ricks. When the Commander tells the station worker to bring Rick D-99/[[Rick Sanchez|C-137]] in, Rick states he will only talk to a Rick with higher clearance. A slightly annoyed Commander in Chief Rick then identifies himself to Rick, which prompts Rick C-137 to swap his mind with the Commander, taking control of his body and identity. Lastly he orders the station worker to blow up the ship with Rick D-99 because "he's a spy" before saying ''I'm gonna go take a shit'' and promptly leaving''.''

Rick heads to the station from where the Ricks can teleport the entire [[Citadel of Ricks]] to any location in the universe using only buttons and dials. Remarking on how bad of an idea that is, he pushes a worker aside and types in the coordinates to the Galactic Federation Prison and sends the Citadel crashing into it. Again he exits after saying ''I'm gonna go take a shit''.

As the possibility that the modified brainalyzer that Rick used to take over other Rick's bodies may have been destroyed exists, Commander in Chief Rick may have been later disguised as [[Quantum Rick]]'s in order to assassinate the other members of the [[Council of Ricks]].
