'''Nicky Smith or Nicky Sanchez''' was a minor character that appears in the episode ''[[Total Rickall]]''.

==History==
In a flashback scene, he is shown saving the Smith family and [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] from within a broken elevator after they see the Hulk Musical. He was also present when the family was captured by a Nazi while on board a Nazi submarine until they are saved by [[Mr. Beauregard]]. Like many of the other characters within the episode, he is a persona taken by the [[Alien Parasites]].

[[Rick Sanchez]] deduces pretty quickly that Cousin Nicky might be a parasite, and shoots him in the shoulder early in the episode.

It is unknown whose cousin he is supposed to be, although due to his age he was mostly likely created as Jerry or Beth's cousin, and Summer and Morty's second cousin.

==Trivia==
* He was the parasite that lived for the shortest period of time.
* His catchphrase is most likely a reference to Midnight Cowboy quote "I'm walkin' here".
