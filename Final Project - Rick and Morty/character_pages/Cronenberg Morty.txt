'''Cronenberg Morty''' is a version of [[Morty Smith]] who originates from [[Cronenberg World]]. In the episode "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]", [[Cronenberg Rick]] and Cronenberg Morty take a portal to a [[Cronenberged dimension|"Cronenberged" version of Earth]] after they discovered that C-137 Rick turned the entire population of Earth, except [[Beth]], [[Jerry]] and [[Summer]], into [[Cronenbergs]]. Cronenberg Rick and Cronenberg Morty did this because they turned the entire population of Cronenberg World into normal Humans and wanted to live in a world where they would fit in.
