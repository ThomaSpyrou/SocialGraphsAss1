'''Cronenberg Rick''' is a version of [[Rick Sanchez]] who originates from [[Cronenberg World]]. He and [[Cronenberg Morty|his grandson]] moved to the [[Cronenberged dimension|Cronenberged dimension]] after everyone there were turned into Cronenbergs. 

==Biography==
In the episode "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]" Cronenberg Rick and [[Cronenberg Morty]] take a portal to a recently "Cronenberged" version of [[Earth]] after they discovered that C-137 Rick turned the entire population, except [[Beth]], [[Jerry]] and [[Summer]], into [[Cronenbergs]]. Cronenberg Rick and Cronenberg Morty did this because they accidentally turned the entire population of Cronenberg World into normal Humans and wanted a world where they would fit in.

In "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]" Cronenberg Rick and Cronenberg Morty were in the background as [[Rick]] and [[Morty]] were being escorted through the [[Citadel of Ricks]].

In [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], many Ricks are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Cronenberg Rick is one of the Ricks who died. If he was able to survive that case, it's unknown if he was present and died during the destruction of the Citadel or left it and survived his likely demise.

In [[Rick and Morty Issue 45]], it's shown that after spending months in Cronenberged dimension, he has gone crazy and assembled a team of most evil Ricks in the multiverse, consisting of [[Nega-Rick]], [[Sci-Fi Politician Rick]], [[Killer Droid Rick]] and [[Black Magic Rick]] to free [[Old God Rick]] from his prison so he can raze the multiverse and grant them unlimited power. However, [[Summer Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Summer]] from this dimension stopped them by blowing up their base with a neutrino bomb attached to Rick C-137's old spaceship. It's unknown if this is how he actually died, though.
