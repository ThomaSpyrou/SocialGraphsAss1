'''Crowscare''' is a sentient scarecrow and [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]'s arch-nemesis during his ''Rick and Two Crows'' phase.

He was the former partner of the [[Two Crows|two crows]] but they get back together, much to Rick's consternation.

==Appearance==
Crowscare's opening appearance differs from his actual one. In the opening, he is shown as a massive and frightening scarecrow, with sharp teeth, glowing eyes and tusks.

His actual appearance is much less formidable-looking. He has the straw hat and green robes, but has no teeth or tusks.
