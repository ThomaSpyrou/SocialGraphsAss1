'''Crustolomons'''<ref>[[Rick and Morty Character Guide]] page 61</ref> are large purple four-legged spider-like aliens with four crab-like claws, seven eyes and a vertical mouth. Their bodies are covered by a purple shell. Every ten seconds they make a snickering sound, and they are capable of speaking english.

In the episode "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", Evil Rick and Morty use these creatures as henchmen for keeping all the Mortys prisoner.
