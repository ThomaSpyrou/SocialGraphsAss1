'''Cynthia''' was the secretary of [[Prince Nebulon]] and she kept constantly appearing multiple times in front of him, to inform him about the discoloration of the skin on his butthole-flaps loudly, humiliating him in front of everyone. She died along with the crew when their ship blew up.

==Biography==
Cynthia was a part of the known scammer Prince Nebulon's crew onboard his spaceship. As his assistant, she kept a record of all his appointments and taking notes. She interrupted Prince Nebulon's gloating after [[Rick Sanchez]] escaped the second simulation to inform him of his doctor's appointment about the discoloration of the skin on his butthole-flaps, really loudly. She then did this again after they ended the third simulation containing Rick, and was told loudly by Prince Nebulon to cancel the appointment; though he reaffirmed the appointment shortly after in a lower voice, even telling her to move it up on the list if possible. When the Zigerions later mixed what they believed to be the recipe for [[Concentrated Dark Matter|concentrated dark matter]], their ship exploded and killed most personnel onboard. 

==Appearance==
Cynthia is a short and fat light purple alien girl. She has <span>antennae</span> with green balls on them and a bunch of rumbly spikes on her head. She has big light yellow eyes with red pupils and big puffy cheeks and a short little snout with a mouth on the end. She has four arms. She wears a yellow jumpsuit and white gloves and a black circular badge with a green triangle in it.

==Trivia==
*Strangely enough, unlike other Zigerions, Cynthia is perfectly comfortable with talking about people's genitalia as she was seen yelling to Prince Nebulon about his buttflaps perfectly fine.
