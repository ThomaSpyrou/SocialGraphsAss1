==Biography==
She wrote an article for ''LonelyPortal'' about the different religions aliens would encounter on the planet [[Earth]], which was the newest member of the [[Galactic Federation]]. While traversing through her list, she claimed: one of the largest religions to be "Chris T. Anity" (Christianity) and confused Jesus with [[w:c:harrypotter|Harry Potter]]; "Judyism" (Judaism) to be a cult about wearing tiny hats; "Church of Fandom" to be the largest and most diverse religion with an endless option of deities to worship and scriptures (novels, movies, games) to follow; "Veganism" to be the most violent and destructive sect on Earth; and "The Bees", whom all must hail.
