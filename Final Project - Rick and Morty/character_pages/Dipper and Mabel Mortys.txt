The '''Dipper and Mabel Mortys''' are alternate versions of [[Morty Smith]], modeled after the characters [[w:c:gravityfalls:Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[w:c:gravityfalls:Mabel Pines|Mabel Pines]] from the show ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. They appeared in the [[Citadel of Ricks]] in the episode "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", when Morty is explaining [[The Citadel]] to [[Summer Smith|Summer]].

In the same episode, many Mortys are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Dipper and Mabel Mortys are some of the Mortys who died.

==Appearance==
The two Mortys are dressed up as the two main protagonists of the show, Gravity Falls, where Dipper Morty has the same hat and Mabel Morty has a yellow skirt and hair tied back with a comb.

==Trivia==
*This is not the first reference to ''Gravity Falls'', as both creators have played around with their shows' connection before through the pen, pad and mug going through the portal in ''[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]].''
*Mabel Morty appears in ''[[Pocket Mortys]]'' as [[Girl Morty]].
*Mabel Morty is the second known female Morty since [[Morticia]].
