'''Doom-Nomitron''' was a villain, who fought [[The Vindicators]] in their second battle. He was mentioned, but not seen, in "[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]".

==History==
When The Vindicators assembled for a second time, it was to defeat Doom-Nomitron. [[Rick Sanchez]] and [[Morty Smith]] were not invited due to Rick's personality conflicting with the rest of their team. [[Lady Katana]], [[Diablo Verde]] and [[Calypso]] were killed fighting against Doom-Nomitron.

He hid out on [[Dorian 5]] and used his shape-shifting powers to disguise himself as an inhabitant of the planet. Because of this, The Vindicators decided to exterminate the whole planet to make sure they killed Doom-Nomitron. This became a great shame for The Vindicators who preferred not to talk about it. It did get brought up again during Rick's second "Saw"-like trial.  It was stated by Rick that if he was there they could have avoided the planets destruction.  

== Trivia ==
* His name implies that he's the ''Rick & Morty ''equivalent of'' ''Doctor Doom or Ultron.
