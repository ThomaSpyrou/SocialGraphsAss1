'''Dr. Glip-Glop''' is a minor character introduced in the episode "[[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]". He was initially assigned to treat Jerry, who was suffering from an illness after consuming mutant bacteria. However, as Dr. Glip-Glop was introducing himself, Jerry vomited on him. The goo landed on his eyes and sent him into a murderous rage due to its effects. Before he could attack anyone, he was shot and disintegrated by [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]].

He was labelled by the hospital staff to be the "Best Doctor in the Galaxy."

==Trivia==
*Dr. Glip-Glop shares his name with the derogatory term for Traflorkians, a term first described in "[[Ricksy Business]]" . The term is described by Rick as "the N-word and the C-word had a baby, and that baby was raised by all the bad words for jews."
