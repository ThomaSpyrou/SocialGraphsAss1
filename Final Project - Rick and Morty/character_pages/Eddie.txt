== Biography ==
The original Eddie presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

Eddie is the Tina-Teer for fire and has a ring that has the power to shoot flames when the word "fire" is said. When [[Planetina]] was summoned to Eco-Con while she was with [[Morty Smith|Morty]], the security guards promptly took Morty into a closet. Eddie came in and tried to burn Morty's face but Morty kicked Eddie and a fight ensued. Morty then bit off Eddie's finger and used his fire ring against him, resulting in his death. Morty then took Eddie's skull and gave it to the other Tina-Teers while they were talking to the Arab ambassador before killing everyone in the room.
