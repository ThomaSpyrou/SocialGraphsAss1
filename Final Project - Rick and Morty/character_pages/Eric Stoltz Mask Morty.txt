'''Eric Stoltz Mask Morty''' is an alternate version of [[Morty Smith]] who originates from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz Mask people. He was assigned to be [[Doofus Rick]]'s Morty since Doofus Rick never had any son or daughter. He appeared in "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]" playing cards with other Mortys. Eric Stoltz Mask Morty is a member of the [[Citadel's militia]].

In [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], many Mortys are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Eric Stoltz Mask Morty is one of the Mortys who died.

==Trivia==
*With Doofus Rick being assigned as his Rick, it is assumed that an Eric Stoltz Mask Rick is dead.
*The concept of this Morty having an Eric Stoltz "mask" is a reference to how Eric Stoltz played the role of [[Wikipedia:Roy L. Dennis|Rocky Dennis]], in the movie [[Wikipedia:Mask (film)|Mask]], by putting on a mask that made him look as though he had [[Wikipedia:Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia|craniodiaphyseal dysplasia]].
*It's also a reference to Eric Stoltz being the actor originally cast to play Marty McFly in Back to the Future, before being replaced by Michael J Fox.
