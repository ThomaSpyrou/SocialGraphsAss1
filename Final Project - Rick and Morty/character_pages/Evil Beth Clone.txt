==Biography==
[[File:Evilclones.jpeg|thumb|left|Evil Beth Clone's death, along with her husband and daughter.]]Evil Beth Clone appeared at the beginning of the episode ''[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]'', where she, along with her husband [[Evil Jerry Clone]], and their daughter [[Evil Summer Clone]], were chasing [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] through an alien spaceship, trying to kill them. Rick was tackled by the clones and they started clawing at him and chewing on his flesh which lead Rick to toss Morty a remote and press the button. Morty was horrified, not wanting to kill his parents and sister, but Rick tried to convince him that they weren't his parents and sister. Evil Beth Clone then confronted Morty and then started to act very sweet and nice, telling him that she loves him, trying to convince him to believe she was his real mother [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth Smith]]. Morty ran from her and activated the remote, killing the family of evil clones and causing them to burn and melt to the ground, freeing Rick from their grasp. They both escaped back to the garage in [[Dimension C-137]], where Morty was so traumatized by the events, that he threw up all over the garage floor.
