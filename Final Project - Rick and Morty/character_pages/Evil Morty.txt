'''{{PAGENAME}}''', sometimes known as "'''Eye Patch Morty'''," formerly known as '''"President Morty"''' or '''"Candidate Morty"''' prior to his election, is the main antagonist of ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]]''.

He serves as the main antagonist of the episodes "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind|Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]", “[[The Ricklantis Mixup]]“, and “[[Rickmurai Jack]]”. A fictional version of him created by the Story Train also appears as a minor antagonist in “[[Never Ricking Morty]]”. 

This Morty is one of the many versions of [[Morty Smith|Morty]] from across the multiverse, known to be ruthless, and perhaps as capable as [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]. Before its near-total destruction, Evil Morty served as the first Morty to be democratically elected President of [[The Citadel]], and had consolidated his power in a coup by eliminating any disagreeable Ricks in the [[Shadow Council of Ricks|Shadow Council]]. He later used this rise to power to fabricate an escape from the [[Central Finite Curve]], killing many of the Ricks and Mortys within The Citadel.

Due to his previously mysterious nature, he was at the center of various [[President Morty/Theories|theories]]. As of the season 5 finale, none of the theories have been confirmed.

==Biography==
[[File:Eyepatchevilmorty.jpg|thumb|220px|The future President Morty wearing an eye patch.<ref>[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]</ref>|left]]
President Morty, then known as Eye Patch Morty, first appeared in "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind|Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]", where he remotely controlled [[Evil Rick]] using a transmitter hidden beneath his eye patch. Using Evil Rick as a ruse, Eye Patch Morty killed off twenty-seven known Ricks from various dimensions, as well as capturing, torturing, and enslaving hundreds of Mortys. After [[Evil Rick]] is killed by a horde of rabid Mortys, Eye Patch Morty is "rescued" by the [[Council of Ricks]]. During [[Evil Rick]]'s autopsy, a Rick officer notices that [[Evil Rick]] has a receiver in his head, allowing him to be remotely controlled. As they speculate as to who has the transmitter, the next scene shows Evil Morty taking off his distinctive eyepatch. The eyepatch is revealed to be the transmitter, and he was the one controlling "Evil Rick". This Morty subsequently smashes the transmitter under his foot, achieving anonymity and access to the Citadel, which presumably was the intended result of his entire plan.

A year later, in "[[Tales From the Citadel]]," now known as Candidate Morty (presumably having survived the Citadel battle in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]"), he secretly develops an alter-ego to become a presidential candidate in an election for the newly democratic [[Citadel of Ricks]]. His candidacy is considered a joke by the Ricks of the Citadel due to being a Morty who no one takes seriously, including his [[Campaign Manager Morty]]. But, after making a rousing speech about the class divide between the various Ricks and Mortys on the Citadel during the debate, he quickly earned praise and support. Shortly after the speech, he promptly fires Campaign Manager Morty.
[[File:EvilMorty.PNG|thumb|220x220px|The former-Candidate Morty, now President of the Citadel, snaps for the guard to kill most of the council.]]
Campaign Manager Morty is depressed and drinking heavily in a bar when an [[Investigator Rick]] gives him a file revealing Candidate Morty's past as Eye Patch Morty and true nature as being the one to have been controlling "Evil Rick". Horrified at the truth, Campaign Manager Morty tries to assassinate Candidate Morty to prevent him from winning the election and is quickly arrested. Unfortunately for him, Candidate Morty survived the assassination attempt and won. Although Campaign Manager Morty tries to reveal Candidate Morty's true identity to the authorities, he is executed by being ejected into space with the file. The now-President Morty meets with Rick Leaders on a shadow council of Ricks, who tell him that they were the real power in the Citadel long before the Council of Ricks and that he'll have no real power. He asks for those who feel this way to raise their hands; he snaps his fingers and all the Ricks with raised hands are swiftly executed. The remaining two instantly back down and cooperate. President Morty then sets his plans into motion by eliminating the old school that partnered Mortys with Ricks, creating new Citadel police rules that allowed a Rick police officer to go free after killing his Morty partner, and turning himself into a dictator. He creates new banners and throws every Rick or Morty that opposed him out of the airlock.

President Morty appears in "[[Never Ricking Morty]]", where he is in an anthology created by [[Story Lord]]. He is seen with his trademark eyepatch along with cyborg arm and a cape. He leads his army against Rick and Morty.

In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", President Morty invites Rick C-137 and Morty to have dinner with him. He asks Rick to tell him how to bring down the [[Central Finite Curve]], but Rick refuses. He implies to Morty that Rick C-137 helped create the Citadel, and says it's a shame that Rick won't help. Despite this, he should have what he needs anyway; Rick's brain was scanned during the appetizers (he had kept previous scans taken by [[Evil Rick]] in "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]"). Just to make sure, he checks Rick's memories on the brain-scanning device planted in the dining room. Morty apologizes to Rick for bringing him to the Citadel. President Morty expresses disdain for Morty's sell-out nature, but says that it would be pointless to hate him for it; Mortys are "bred" by the Citadel for their forgiveness. The Citadel has become a self-perpetuating market for Mortys, with Citadel Ricks manipulating events to ensure Jerrys and Beths end up together.

Rick tries to shoot President Morty, but the shot is blocked by a force-shield; President Morty tells the guards to let Rick and Morty go. Rick opens a [[Portal Technology|portal]] to leave, but after seeing President Morty's smug face realizes that it's a trap. President Morty has hacked his [[Portal Gun|portal gun]], again. After defeating the guards, President Morty tells Rick that he can't run from his past. Rick shoots at President Morty again, but the force-shield is still up. President Morty asks Rick why he thought the shield would be down the second time. Rick says it's just him expressing disapproval at his dialogue.

Rick C-137 and his Morty encounter President Morty again when he's at the Citadel's Dimensional Drive preparing to bring down the Finite Curve. President Morty explains to Morty that Ricks see themselves as the underdogs, and in this way justify their heinous actions to themselves. They built the Central Finite Curve, a multidimensional wall that separates all the infinite universes where Rick isn't the smartest man alive from all the infinite universes where he is the smartest man alive. President Morty says that what makes himself "evil" is that he hates Rick and wants to leave. Any Mortys who've ever been sick of Rick have also been Evil Morty. He's destroying the Central Finite Curve and the Citadel to free himself of Rick.

President Morty activates his Dimensional Drive protocol, powering it with the blood of Operation Phoenix clones. The Citadel starts to break apart and President Morty offers Morty a chance to escape with him. Rick tells Morty it's a better deal than staying, but Morty chooses to remain with Rick. They leave the chamber together, and President Morty gets into his small spaceship. He flies through the opening in the Central Finite Curve and uses his [[President Morty's Portal Gun|own portal gun]], one filled with a unique golden fluid. His current whereabouts are unknown.

==Personality==
[[File:S1e10 evil morty.png|thumb|220x220px|The future-President Eye Patch Morty ripping off his eyepatch exposing wiring from his eye.]]
To the public, President Morty appears to be a compassionate, understanding, and calm Morty who believes that the main problem with the Citadel of Ricks is inequality. He expresses dismay at the division between Ricks and Mortys, and the division between the Ricks who are on the top and the Ricks who are average workers even though they have the same IQ and are barely different. By espousing these views, he manages to actually beat the Rick candidates and win the election, despite him being a Morty and, in the eyes of the Ricks, a joke.

However, once he wins the election and meets with the shadow Council of Ricks, his true nature is revealed. In reality, he is a cold, manipulative, sadistic, cunning, ruthless, highly intelligent, and a tyrannical dictator, almost mirroring most Ricks and even exceeding them at times. He shows no hesitation in killing Ricks or even Mortys who don't agree with his ideals and shows delight when he finally has the opportunity to put his plans into action.

President Morty is also willing to watch through Evil Rick as hundreds of Mortys suffer in pain, creating the large camouflage dome for his base of operations. Despite speaking about equality for Ricks and Mortys, he is willing to use or even sacrifice versions of himself for his goals.

When President Morty was first seen, little was shown about him, but he stated that it is impossible for a Morty to defeat a Rick. In the episode, it was revealed that he was controlling his Rick and it was possibly his idea to capture Mortys in order to hide from the Citadel of Ricks. Unlike other Mortys, President Morty speaks in a serious, monotone voice, and lacks a stutter in his speech. President Morty's ability to control Evil Rick and become a president both show that, in terms of logical intelligence (as opposed to emotional intelligence), he is much smarter than the average Morty. Ultimately, he outplays even Rick C-137 and breaks through the Finite Curve.

When "Evil Rick" (actually Eye Patch Morty controlling his form) noticed Rick C-137 crying over his memories, he taunts him by saying that Ricks don't care about Mortys. Since Eye Patch Morty was controlling Evil Rick, this suggests that he believes all Ricks treat their Mortys like disposable and replaceable objects. In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" he repeats this, believing and even justifying that Mortys are only bred by Ricks for camouflage and to feel superior, justifying this by showing how Ricks continuously force infinite Jerrys and Beths to be together.

===Criminal Record===
President Morty, unlike most, has no hesitation in committing atrocities in order to further his goals - whilst using his position as a Morty a cover and alibi to avoid being caught. These include:
* '''Murder:''' He has killed a great number of Ricks and Mortys. It is possible he killed [[Evil Rick Sanchez]] before using his corpse as a puppet.
* '''Mass Murder then Framing:''' In "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", he killed 27 Ricks in such a way to frame [[C-137 Rick]].
* '''Mass Abduction, Human Trafficking, Torture, and Imprisonment:''' In "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", he imprisoned and tortured hundreds and possibly thousands of Mortys. It is possible he may have killed more Ricks or members of the family to obtain them.
* '''Coup d'état:''' In "[[Tales from the Citadel]]", he mass executes the corrupt [[Shadow Council of Ricks]] in order to remove all his political opponents.

==Trivia==
[[File:PresidentEvilMorty.png|thumb|200px|President Morty art by Peter Slavik.<ref>[https://twitter.com/petarsaur/status/907125050905464834 Peter Slavik Twitter - Tales From the Citadel]</ref>]]
*President Morty's starring episodes, "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", "[[Tales From the Citadel]]", and "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" end with "For the Damaged Coda<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l89Fq4Z2w30</ref>" playing in the background (as well as the closing credits for the former two). The song has thus become President Morty's leitmotif.
**"[[Never Ricking Morty]]" is the only episode to not feature the theme at all.
*The floating photographs of President Morty show the eye patch on the left eye, while the first time he was shown, the eye patch was on the right eye. Similarly, his jacket pocket is on the other side as well. It's uncertain whether this indicates a mirror image (intentional or not) or that the photos had been staged for Campaign Manager Morty by President Morty himself.
*The nickname, "Evil Morty", was originally provided to this Morty by the wider fan community in reference to him controlling the explicitly named "Evil Rick", and was used unofficially by various members of the show's staff until the season 5 finale, when Rick calls him such. President Morty is amused that Rick is finally "all caught up".
**At the Citadel's Dimensional Drive, President Morty also tells Morty that "now [he's] Evil Morty too" when Morty questions Rick's motives.
*At the end of "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind", Rick C-137 warns his Morty about becoming too smart for his own good, and he defers on explaining that statement to Morty until he is older. This appears to be a veiled reference to President Morty going rogue.
*President Morty wanted the memories of the show's main Rick to find out how to deactivate the Finite Curve.
*At one point, fans thought that President Morty might be an anti-hero instead of an outright villain. It was theorized that his more violent attempts at guaranteeing his own presidency stemmed from him realizing the potential of nearly all Ricks to inadvertently destroy everything and everyone around them permanently, including entire dimensions. However, the season 5 finale proved that his goals were ultimately selfish if sympathetic, bringing him closer to an anti-villain.
*Despite showing mild sympathy for other Mortys, President Morty doesn't care that his plan will kill the Mortys on the Citadel. In fact, his machine is fueled, in part, by the blood of Mortys.
**It is also worth noting that President Morty says that sellout Mortys "kill" him, indicating that he shows much distaste towards versions of himself who care about Rick's approval.
*According to Rick, President Morty is the only person who's ever been able to hack his [[Portal Gun]].
