'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Mega Seeds|Mega Fruit]] farmer on [[The Citadel]].

==Biography==
{{PAGENAME}} worked as a farmer on The Citadel with his trusted robot dog. One day, four Mortys ([[Slick Morty|Slick]], [[Left-Handed Morty|Left-Handed]], [[Lizard Morty|Lizard]] and [[Glasses Morty|Glasses]]) sneaked onto his farm to steal his Mega Fruit. He fired a warning shot before sending his robot dog after the intruders, chasing them into the nearby river.

Those four Mortys would return after [[President Morty]] changed the Citadel to focus more on Mortys. {{PAGENAME}} objected to the Mortys taking his fruit, but the Guard Ricks present would not stop them. 

{{PAGENAME}} was seen killing [[Morty Smith|Morty of C-137]] in a possible future seen by a [[Death Crystal]].

==Appearance==
Mega Fruit Farmer Rick looks similar to [[Rick Sanchez]], but has a long beard, long hair, and wears a hat and overalls.
