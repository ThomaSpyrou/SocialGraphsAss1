First seen in [[Pilot]], the alien is seen briefly for a few seconds when [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] are trying to escape the customs staff ([[Gromflomites]]). When [[Morty Smith|Morty]] coughs after another alien, who is smoked what appears to Cannabis (or something of the same likeness), the creature is born. However after a few seconds, it has already aged and died.
