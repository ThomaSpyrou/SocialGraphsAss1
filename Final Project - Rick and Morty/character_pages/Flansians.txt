The '''Flansians''' are an alien species who appear in the background in the ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' universe. 

==History==
A Flansian couple was at [[Nuptia 4]] for marriage counseling before [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Jerry Smith]]'s mythologs broke out of their cells and went on a murderous rampage. Another couple were present at the wedding of [[Birdperson]] and [[Tammy Gueterman|Tammy]] on [[Planet Squanch]] before being gunned down by [[Galactic Federation]] agents.

==Biology==

Flansians generally have yellow scaly skin and a large head with one very big eye. They have two long thin legs, and their equally long and thin arms end in hands with three finger. Despite their scaly skin, the female Flansians do grow large amounts of hair on their head, and both genders wear clothes.
