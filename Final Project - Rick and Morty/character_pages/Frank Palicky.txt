'''Frank Palicky''' was a student at [[Harry Herpson High School]]. He was a frequent bully to [[Morty Smith|Morty]], and his dialogue with Morty suggests that Frank is insecure about his family's socioeconomic status.

==Biography==
In the ''[[Pilot]]'', Frank pulls a switchblade on Morty and threatens to cut him, incorrectly accusing Morty of saying he was poor. [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] freezes Frank and drags Morty off. [[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer]] steps onto the scene and tries to flirt with Frank, not noticing that he's currently frozen. His left foot shatters causing him to fall over and shatter into pieces, causing her to scream in horror. Later on when [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] and [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]] visited the school, they saw their daughter Summer and some other boys and girls having a funeral for Frank.

==Trivia==
*Frank was the first character to die in the show.
*According to the DVD Commentary for ''[[Pilot]]'', his voice actor [[Ryan Ridley]] wants to reprise the role, and has suggested it since the new universe was opened in ''[[Rick Potion No. 9]]'', but Harmon and Roiland did not seem interested and said the character was supposed to die from the beginning anyway.
*Summer states "What kind of god would let this happen?", briefly introducing the cosmic struggle for the meaning of life and the existence of god that the series has a tendency to bring up often.
*According to the ''[[Rick and Morty Character Guide]]'' he was born in 2001 and died in 2017.<ref name=RMCG />
