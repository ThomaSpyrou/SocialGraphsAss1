The '''Galactic Federation President''' was the president of the [[Galactic Federation]]. He committed suicide after [[Rick Sanchez]] changed the value of the [[Blemflarck]], the federation's single, centralized unit of currency, from $1 to $0.

==Trivia==
* Despite the fact that The Galactic Federation President appeared in only one episode and that he was never mentioned prior to his appearance, the fact that he ruled over the Galactic federation itself automatically makes him one of the show's antagonists since the Galactic Federation and many of its members are also antagonists.
