'''Garblovians''' are an alien race in the [[Rick and Morty]] multiverse. They speak what sounds like a nonsense language, saying things like "Aga blah blah" or "Gaggablaghblagh" while expecting every other race to understand. Garblovians frequently explode into a blue gooey mess. It is unknown why they explode. [[Jerry]] tries unsuccessfully to communicate with a few varieties of them after trying to leave the [[Jerryboree|daycare center]].

Garblovians seem to have cannibalistic tendencies, as a pair of Garblovians were seen drinking the liquid remains of a fellow Garblovian who previously exploded in front of Jerry.
