"'''Geardude'''" '''Clockberg''' was a friend of [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]], [[Birdperson]] and [[Squanchy]], a member of [[Freedom Fighters Crew]] among them, and [[Revolio Clockberg, Jr.|Gearhead's]] older brother.

== Appearance ==
Geardude wore his light green hair in a long mullet, which matched with his armbands. His clothes consisted of a red vest and headband, yellow undershirt, brown pants, a red belt, a blue gun holster, orange socks, purple shoes and fingerless gloves. He wore a necklace with a cog wheel attached and wore the Freedom Fighters Crew logo on his right shoulder. His weapon of choice was a large multicolored minigun. 

== History ==
Geardude lived on [[Gear World]] at the time when the [[Galactic Federation]] was attempting to take over the universe. He met [[Rick Sanchez]], [[Birdperson]] and [[Squanchy]] at some point prior to them forming the [[Freedom Fighters Crew]]; a group of rebels fighting against the Galactic Federation. Geardude was present at the crew's meeting before they shot off to [[Glapflap]]'s third moon, where they fought in what later became known as the infamous [[Glapflap|Battle of Blood Ridge]]. They won the battle against the [[Gromflomites]] and stopped their attempted takeover of the universe for the time. 

Geardude died a number of years after the great battle. His funeral was held on Gear World where his former teammates Rick, Birdperson and Squanchy came to give their final goodbye. Geardude left his younger brother, [[Revolio Clockberg, Jr.|Gearhead]], whom Rick and the others took in as their friend in memory of his older brother.
