'''Glasses Morty (aka Specs)'''  is a version of Morty who wears glasses. He made his first official appearance as a supporting character in a quartet of other Mortys in the [[Season 3]] episode, "[[Tales From the Citadel]]". He attends the Morty Academy, and is close friends with [[Left-Handed Morty]], [[Lizard Morty]], and formerly [[Slick Morty]], before the latter supposedly committed suicide.
==Appearance==
Glasses Morty looks identical to [[Morty Smith]], but he wears black, thick-rimmed glasses.

==Personality==
Like the other Morty's, Glasses Morty is good-natured, kindhearted, and abnormally hormonal. He is also slightly more emotionally intelligent and understanding than other Mortys.

==Appearances==
===[[Season 1]]===
*"[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]" (Pictured)
===[[Season 3]]===
*"[[Tales From the Citadel]]"
===Other Media===
*[[Rickstaverse]]
*[[Pocket Mortys]]

==Trivia==
*It is implied that Glasses Morty likes incest porn since he wished that "incest porn had a more mainstream appeal."
**This is a reference to his role in the ''[[Rickstaverse]]'' comic, "[[The Good Morty]]", from his pictured appearance in the [[Season 1]] episode, "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]".
*He is nicknamed "Specs" by the other Mortys.
*His thick glasses are possibly inspired by the character Teddy Duchamp from the 1986 film ''Stand by Me.''
