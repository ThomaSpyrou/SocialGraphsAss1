}}'''GlorpDieBlorp''' is a [[Garblovians|garblovian]] online game streamer. He is famous for playing jumpscare games and exploding into goo when he is really frightened, which his fans seem to expect and anticipate upon watching his stream. During his stream he receives donations from viewers, as well as ''blorb'' (some kind of food) dropping down from above him into his mouth. He was one of the earlier aliens to receive the game "[[Ten Tuesdays at Tinkles]]".
