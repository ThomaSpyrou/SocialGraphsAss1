}}'''Gorpathian Dermaks''' are grey aliens resembling the stereotypical appearance of an alien. They are known as huge perverts who abduct and probe creatures for fun or enjoyment.

==History==
Gorpathian Dermaks abducted the [[Smith Family]] in their car, along with a cow. They transported the cow to another room using an anti-gravity beam, later returning for the Smiths. While gone, the Smiths devised a plan to escape the probing. With [[Rick]]'s robot body, they gassed the aliens before attacking them with guns. They were rescued by Rick's portal, with him having activated a bomb in his robot body's butt. The bomb blew up the ship, presumably killing all Gorpathian Dermaks inside.

==Trivia==
* Gorpathian Dermaks are a parody of stereotypical aliens presented in movies and TV-series
