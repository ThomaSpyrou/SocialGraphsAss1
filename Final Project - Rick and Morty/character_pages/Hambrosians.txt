'''Hambrosians''' are a species of polydimensional aliens, meaning that they exist on several planes of reality at once. 

==Appearance==
Their appearances are reminiscent of sea creatures, with fin-like hands and squid-like head-top. They seem to generally have blue skin and yellow eyes.

==Biology==
Being polydimensional, or 'poly', they do not seem to enjoy their stay on [[Earth]], as it appears on only one plane of reality (it does have one more plane where dogs and humans have changed roles, but it was a little "too far-fetched" for Hambrosians taste). And because Hambrosian genitals don't start manifesting until plane ζ, they are unable to form sexual bonds with any humans.

A Hambrosian named '''X’Ulililir Popoiv''' wrote an article in a magazine called Nazz about this, titled "Earth Sucks If You’re Poly: a NAZZ Special Report". <ref name="nazz article">{{cite web | title = Earth Sucks If You’re Poly: a NAZZ Special Report | url = http://fedconnect.galacticfederation.com/post/158417489298/earth-sucks-if-youre-poly-a-nazz-special-report | accessdate = 2017-03-29 }}</ref>

==History==
Hambrosians could be seen at [[Blips and Chitz]] in "[[Mortynight Run]]" when [[Rick]] brought [[Morty]] there for the first time. 

Another Hambrosian was invited to [[Birdperson]] and [[Tammy]]'s wedding on [[Planet Squanch]] in "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]" and was killed by the [[Galactic Federation]].

==Trivia==
*They appear to be used to being discriminated against
*Their saying, "For the love of Grundis", could point to their God being named Grundis
