He first appeared in the episode "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind|Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]". He appeared again, and was gravely injured, possibly fatally, in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption|The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", when a guard for the Council of Ricks used him as a weapon and a meat shield. After taking many shots for the guard, who was killed shortly after, Hammerhead Morty was last seen kneeling on the ground suffering from his injuries. It is unknown if he survived.

==Appearance==
Hammerhead Morty is a Caucasian teenage boy with the head of a giant hammer. His hammer head appears to be made of gray metal, and his face is located on the face of the hammer. Hammerhead Morty's hands, however, seem to be made out of human flesh. This is backed up by the fact that when Hammerhead Morty was shot, he had red bullet wounds.  His body seems to be rounded and pole-shaped, just like the handle of a hammer, implying that his entire body could be a hammer. Hammerhead Morty wears a yellow t-shirt, like all of the other Mortys.
