{{quote|I love you son. I should've never turned you to ice.|Helium-Q's final words to Water-T|Season 2}}'''Helium-Q''' is an elder of [[Alphabetrium]] and the father of [[Ice-T]].<ref name="Get Schwifty">[[Get Schwifty]]</ref>

He initially disapproved of his son because he didn't care enough about anything. This would eventually lead him to turn his son into ice and exile him into the cosmos. After receiving word that his son saved Earth from the [[Cromulons]], he forgave him and granted him his original form as Water-T. Moments later, [[Alphabetrium]] was under attack by the [[Numbericons]] and Helium-Q dies from a ceiling collapse. Water-T goes on a killing rampage against the Numbericons, avenging his father's death.<ref name="Get Schwifty">[[Get Schwifty]]</ref>
