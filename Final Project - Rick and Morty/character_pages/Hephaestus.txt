'''Hephaestus''' is the Greek god of blacksmiths, metalworking, carpenters, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metallurgy, fire, and volcanoes. Hephaestus was recruited in Rick's heist crew in [[One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty]] to stop Heistotron.

==Biography==
Hephaestus is working in a volcano when [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] enter to recruit him for a team to deal with [[Heistotron]]'s betrayal. He joins the team in [[The Garage]] to discuss a plan of action, and watches Rick play Minecraft while waiting for [[Randotron]] to signal the beginning of the heist. However, [[Ventriloquiver]], inspecting Earth's constellations, helps Rick to realize that [[Earth]] had already been heisted, and they were viewing a recorded sky. This is when Randotron decides to begin the team's heist, firing mind controlling darts at every member of the team, including Hephaestus, causing them to take a random action against Heistotron's algorithm.

Hephaestus, on Randotron's orders, proceeds to ''Vomit's Grocery'', where he picks up a box of diapers, throws away a free sample mini weenie, and takes a bite out of the box of diapers, before rushing outside to parkour up the front of the building to begin doing one-handed pushups on the roof. Eventually, he arrives alongside the rest of the team at [[Heistotron]]'s space station, scooting on the ground like the rest. He is with the crew for the next two hours as Rick and Heistotron are both repeatedly claiming they programmed the other to believe what they do, eventually resulting in Rick getting the last word. Heistotron self destructs, as his space station begins to do the same, prompting Rick to return everyone, including Hephaestus, through their respective [[Portal Gun|portal]] home.

==Trivia==
*Hephaestus is derived from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus| Greek and Roman mythology], most likely to illustrate the randomness of Rick's crew selection.
