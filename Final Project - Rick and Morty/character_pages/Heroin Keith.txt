== Biography ==
The original Heroin Keith presumably became a Cronenberg in the [[Cronenberged dimension]].

Heroin Keith is a heroin addict that appears in [[The Vat of Acid Episode]]. He goes on a joyride with [[Morty Smith|Morty]] who is running people over but Keith is concerned that Morty is living too fast. Morty then tells him that he doesn't pay for his friendship which leaves Keith speechless. Keith is then seen with a crowd of protesters in the [[Merged Universe]] looking at the vat of "acid" that Morty jumped into.

Heroin Keith presumably has a counterpart in Dimension C-131.
