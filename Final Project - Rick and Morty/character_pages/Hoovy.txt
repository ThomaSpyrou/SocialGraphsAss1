== Biography  ==
At some point in his life, Hoovy met Bova and the two conceived a child together. Hoovy himself claimed he messed up several times during the early days of his and Bova's relationship, but she loved him for doing so. He didn't seem to take much interest in the wine [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] threw into his dimension to age, brushing it off as "that crate full of alcohol that's been here for decades."

When [[Morty Smith]] came to Hoovy's dimension to retrieve the aged wine, Hoovy helped him carry it and entered the Replacement dimension for a short time. However, during this brief visit, decades passed in his own world. Upon returning, Hoovy found Bova had given birth to their son, [[Japheth]] and subsequently passed away. A now adult Japheth stabbed Hoovy as revenge for abandoning them. Hoovy told his son it wasn't his fault and blamed Morty for his absence before dying from his wound. Hoovy's final words set off a chain of events where Japheth and Hoovy's descendants waited for Morty to return so they could finally kill him.

It is quite possible this domino effect leading to Hoovy's demise was entirely avoidable (as it appears Morty forgetfully, or even through naivet√©, actively chose to close the [[Portal Technology|gateway]] behind him as he entered the [[The Garage|garage]] with his new friend) though, it appears Morty never quite realized Hoovy's fate, misidentifying Japheth as his father several times thereafter.

==Trivia==
*While it is never explicitly stated how the gateway technology functions, there are several times it displays the capability to stay open manually (even ''after'' the user has returned home) and appears to be wholly controlled by the corresponding remote under "normal" circumstances.
**This seems to confirm Morty's propensity for unintentionally doing more harm than good whenever he is seen trying to benefit the local populace of a given region. Some noteworthy examples include [[Meeseeks and Destroy]] when Morty tries to help some distraught villagers (leading to the untimely death of a giant named [[Dale]]), "[[Look Who's Purging Now]]" when he offers [[Arthricia]] shelter on [[Purge Planet]] (followed by her promptly and decisively betraying the group), and the time-bending catastrophe which ensued when [[Slippy]] was returned to [[Snake Planet]] in "[[Rattlestar Ricklactica]]", soothing Morty's guilty conscience after he was responsible for the death of a Space Snake.
