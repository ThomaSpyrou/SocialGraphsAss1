== Biography ==
He, along with other versions of the Smith family, was invited by Rick C-137 on a cook-off to discuss the repairment of their GoTrons. During the discussion, he had an outburst, blaming the main Smith family for acting better than them, and wanting to leave on his GoTron, which blew up, prompting Hothead Rick to leave to his dimension using his [[Portal Gun]].

Then, during a fight with GoTron Ferrets, he catapulted out when the red ferret began launching fire on the incomplete GoTron. He tried to ran away, but the ferret burned him.

== Appearance ==
Hothead Rick wears a white shirt with black pants on overalls. His hair is curly, and he also ironically wears a cross on his neck, despite most versions of Rick being atheists.

== Trivia ==
*Hothead Rick is seemingly a parody of Sonny Corleone from Mario Puzo's 1969 crime novel ''The Godfather'' and its 1972 film adaptation.
