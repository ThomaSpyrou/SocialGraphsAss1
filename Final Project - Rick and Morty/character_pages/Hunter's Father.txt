He works as a police officer who responds to a call of [[Rick's ship]] causing violence when it's set in "Keep Summer Safe" mode.

His only son, [[Hunter]], drowned in 1996 at the age of only 7 years old. He blames himself for his son's death, and Rick's ship uses this to its advantage by briefly recreating his deceased son in an act of psychological warfare.
