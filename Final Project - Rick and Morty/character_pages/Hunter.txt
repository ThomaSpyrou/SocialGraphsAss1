'''Hunter''' was the son of [[Hunter's Father|a police officer]], who died drowned in a pool at the age of only 7 years old in 1996 according to the news article covering his death. He was briefly recreated by [[Rick's ship]] after [[Summer Smith]] insisted she not be protected by violent means. The Hunter's recreation asked the child's father to leave the car alone before disintegrating into purple slime, causing lasting psychological trauma at the man.
