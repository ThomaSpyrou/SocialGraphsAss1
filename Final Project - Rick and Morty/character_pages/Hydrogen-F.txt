==Biography==
The Alphabetrians turned [[Ice-T|Water-T]] into Ice-T when he refused to care about anyone, and banished him from their world. He would only be able to return if he learned to care about other people.

After Ice-T helped save [[Earth]] from the [[Cromulons]], he returned to his home planet to meet with the elders. {{PAGENAME}} and her fellow elders had heard of Ice-T's feat, and granted him back his original form. This was immediately followed by the [[Numbericons]] attacking Alphabetrium, causing a large rock to fall down on Helium-Q and kill him. Water-T drew his guns and attacked the Numbericons to avenge his father.
