'''Insurance Rick''' is a version of [[Rick]] that sells Morty Insurance at [[The Citadel]].

==Biography==
When [[Rick Sanchez]] was brought to the [[Citadel of Ricks]] and walking towards the court room, Insurance Rick tried unsuccessfully to sell him [[Morty]] Insurance.

In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", many Ricks are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Insurance Rick is one of the Ricks who died.

==Appearance==
Insurance Rick is dressed similarly to [[Solicitor Rick]] with the same colored suit and shirt. They differ when it comes to their ties, where this Rick wears a yellow and red-striped tie, and keeps his jacket open.

==Personality==
He has the same pestering personality as the other salesmen at the Citadel of Ricks, with attempting to sell his Morty insurance to Rick while he's being transported as a prisoner to the court room. However, instead of becoming sad by Rick's rejection, he appears quite angry when told to back off.
