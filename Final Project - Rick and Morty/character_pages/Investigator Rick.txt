'''Investigator Rick''' was a Rick in the [[Citadel of Ricks]]. His only appearance was in ''[[Tales From the Citadel]]''.

==Biography==
In ''[[Tales From the Citadel]]'', Investigator Rick gave [[Campaign Manager Morty]] information about [[Evil Morty]] in a bar. The information later led to a failed assassination attempt by Campaign Manager Morty on Evil Morty's life.

Sometime after sharing the secrets with Campaign Manager Morty, Investigator Rick was killed on [[Evil Morty]]'s orders, his lifeless corpse later visible floating in space with other Ricks and Mortys ejected from the Citadel.

==Trivia==
*It is possible, but unlikely, that Evil Morty was controlling Investigator Rick, as he did with [[Evil Rick]]. This may have been because Evil Morty knew that if his former campaign manager learned the truth, he would try to assassinate him in front of a large crowd of supporters, which would earn him votes of sympathy.
**Investigator Rick's Morty was never seen, supporting this theory.
*Usually within media, characters who wear trench coats and face-concealing fedoras do so to hide their identity. Ironically, Investigator Rick ends up standing out due to his outfit. He would be much less conspicuous if he dressed as a standard looking Rick.
**This is most likely a joke in and of itself, as Investigator Rick asks Campaign Manager Morty "It's secrets, what do you think it is? Look how I'm dressed" which is a meta gag on the nature of his outfit.
