'''Invisi-Troopers''' are United States soldiers that are equipped with technology that enables them to turn invisible. They appear during the season three finale "[[The Rickchurian Mortydate]]". 

They are positioned all around [[Rick]] with one holding a knife to his throat. This is during Rick and [[the President]]'s fight over [[Morty]]'s unwanted selfie. After the President tells them to stand down, they become visible. However, Rick claims he "could see them [the] whole time".
