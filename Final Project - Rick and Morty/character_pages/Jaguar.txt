==Biography==
The original Jaguar presumably became a Cronenberg in [[Dimension C-137]].

Jaguar is a highly skilled rebel fighter who dedicated his life toward toppling the oppressive regime ruling his country (presumably Russia). He was eventually captured by a Russian Agency and imprisoned in their maximum security facility. The agency planned on holding him captive until his natural death, until the invasion of [[Pickle Rick (character)|Pickle Rick]]. The [[agency director]] released Jaguar to destroy him. His only motivation was that if he killed Rick, he'd be rewarded by setting his daughter,Â [[Katarina]] free. 

During his fight with Rick, the two exchanged some words and eventually decided to team up, as Rick's mission to see his daughter, [[Beth Smith|Beth]], was similar to his mission to get Katarina back. Rick acted as if he'd killed Jaguar to the agency director, who revealed Katarina was dead and Jaguar was being lied to in order to control him. Ultimately, Jaguar was able to enact revenge upon the director by hijacking his helicopter alongside Pickle Rick and leaving the director to die in an explosion.

Before departing, Jaguar told Rick to ensure Beth knew he loved her. Rick told Jaguar about the infinite amount of Beths he has access to and how he had abandoned entire realities in the past, which led Jaguar to ask if he too had infinite daughters. Rick lied to Jaguar in order to get him to leave, which worked and the latter parachuted away shortly after.

In the episode's epilogue, Rick and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] were about to be killed by [[Concerto]], before Jaguar killed Concerto and saved them both. Jaguar gave Rick a nod before gliding out of a nearby window. When Morty asked who he was, Rick told him that Jaguar was "why you don't go to therapy". 

==Trivia==
*He is voiced by Danny Trejo, best known for his role as Isador "Machete" Cortez from the ''Spy Kids'' film series and the ''Machete'' spinoff films.
