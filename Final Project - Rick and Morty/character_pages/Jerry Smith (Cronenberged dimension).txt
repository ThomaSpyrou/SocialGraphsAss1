'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the original version of the current [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]]. He is married to [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth Smith]], has two children named [[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith]], and is the son-in-law of [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Diane Sanchez]]. He is also the son of [[Leonard Smith|Leonard]] and [[Joyce Smith]], and he has an [[Unnamed Uncle]]. Jerry strongly disapproves of [[Rick]]'s influence over his son. Along with this is his jeopardized marriage to his wife, [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]], whom he finds himself struggling to keep a hold of due to her close relationship with her father. Jerry currently resides in the post-apocalyptic remains of his dimension, along with his wife Beth, and his daughter Summer. Also, he became a feral survivor alongside his wife and daughter and held a disdain for his father-in-law [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]].





==Personality==
Jerry always tries to keep the best interests of his family at heart, but his attempt to be the patriarch of the family can often be misguided by his self-centered nature. This causes him a great deal of conflict with [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]], as his father-in-law clearly has no respect for him whatsoever.

Jerry can sometimes become misguided by his many insecurities. He attempts to ship Rick off to a nursing home in the first episode. In the episode "''[[Anatomy Park (Episode)|Anatomy Park]]"'', Jerry has difficulty overcoming his uncomfortable feelings about his parents' relationship with [[Jacob]], his mother's lover, despite their happiness. Jerry frequently battles with bouts of jealousy, being constantly reminded that his marriage is on rocky ground. He tells Beth that if she ever cheats on him with her assistant Davin he will "blow his brains out" over their naked bodies.

Despite Jerry's weaknesses, he has the ability to channel his inner strength to face his fears, such as directly confronting the army of [[Mr. Meeseeks]], and fighting off the mutated [[Cronenbergs]]. The latter event forced him to not only take charge and fight, but also gave him the confidence to finally become a man Beth could be happy with.

After getting used to living in a post-apocalyptic world, he became a more brave, cruel, sadistic and wild man. It is implied she may have lost some level of his mentality as destroys Rick's portal gun and appears to want to drive off or possibly kill Summer from the replacement dimension.

==Appearance==
Jerry has light skin, dark brown hair, a clean-shaven face, dimples, and an average build. Up until the events of "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]", Jerry wore a dark green shirt with a brown and beige stripe in the middle, light blue long pants, and black shoes. However, after the events of "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]", Jerry's appearance changes. His clothes are now ripped, he's sporting a red bandana, he has short facial hair, and he appears to be more muscular.

In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", Jerry's appearance changes again. He is shirtless, wearing ripped blue pants, black shoes and a green armlet. He also wears a necklace and belt presumably made of cronenberg teeth, and a cape, loincloth and hood made of cronenberg flesh, eyes and teeth. Since his last appearance, he has also become even more muscular. Jerry’s beard has also grown out.

==Relationships==
===[[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]===
Jerry sees his father-in-law Rick as a horrible influence on his son Morty, and wishes to have Rick moved to a nursing home. Jerry's life is frequently affected by Rick's shenanigans, such as the intelligence enhancer Rick made for his dog [[Snuffles]], the [[Meeseeks Box]], and the [[Love Potion|potion]] which brought about a disastrous change in the world.

Rick makes Jerry feel insecure about his intelligence and his marriage, causing Jerry to overcompensate in his effort to prove he is better than Rick, though he's never successful.

In [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], he and his wife and daughter display a deep hatred for Rick through their criticism of his scent on [[Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]]. This hatred is so strong that they destroyed the portal gun after realizing that it was one of Rick's inventions and attempted to kill Summer simply for being involved with Rick.

===[[Morty Smith|Morty]]===
Jerry loves his son Morty and only wants what's best for him, academically and romantically. However, Jerry claims that Morty has some kind of learning disability, and tells Morty that he has to work "twice as hard" in life to keep up. Jerry tries to convince his son that he is just as intelligent as Rick, and gave his son advice about romance, despite the fact that his marriage was falling apart. In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", despite his new feral nature, he, his wife, and his daughter still decide to keep Morty alive, even though he intended to kill the other universe's Summer, which shows that he still has some care for his son.

===[[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]]===
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-05h36m29s41.png|thumb|Jerry with his wife.]]Jerry met his future wife Beth in high school and had unprotected sex with her on prom night, resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first child, Summer. Afterwards, the two got married, and three years later, the couple had their second child, Morty. Their relationship is very rocky and strained, since both of them missed out on fulfilling their dreams due to poor decision-making when they were teenagers. Their marriage is further strained by Beth's close relationship with her father Rick and her willingness to let the family put up with his antics. Jerry seems to still love Beth quite a lot, and tries hard to keep their marriage together, but finds Rick's frequent insults about their relationship hard to ignore.

Jerry does not consider Beth's profession as a horse heart surgeon to be all that big a deal, but tries not to mention it. If Beth were to cheat on him with someone else, Jerry stated that he would commit suicide by blowing his brains out all over her naked body.

After starting to live in a post-apocalyptic world, Jerry became much more courageous and loving toward his wife Beth.

===[[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer]]===
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-05h40m14s64.png|thumb|Jerry with his daughter.]]
Jerry and Summer do not interact very much, but Jerry does care about his daughter. He is hurt when she neglects to tell him about her boyfriend [[Ethan]], and is genuinely happy that his daughter survived the genetic disaster in "''[[Rick Potion No. 9]]''".

In "[[Lawnmower Dog]]", father and daughter spend their time together arguing and watching their dog Snuffles slowly gain sentience.

After starting to live in a post-apocalyptic world, Jerry became much more friendly towards his daughter Summer.
