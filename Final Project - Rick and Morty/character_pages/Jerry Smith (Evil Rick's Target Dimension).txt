}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an alternate version of the original [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]], who appeared in the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], he is the husband of [[Beth Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Beth Smith]], the father of [[Summer Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Summer Smith]] and [[Morty Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Morty Smith]], and the son-in-law of [[Rick Sanchez (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Rick Sanchez]] and Mrs. Sanchez, he is also the son of Leonard Smith and Joyce Smith, and the nephew of the Unnamed Uncle.
==Biography==
In the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], Jerry is seen sitting at the table, eating breakfast with his family, when all of a sudden [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty]] appeared from a portal in the room. Evil Rick and Evil Morty shoot his father-in-law [[Rick Sanchez (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Rick]] and tranquilize and kidnap his son [[Morty Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Morty]], leaving Jerry screaming in terror and asking what was going on, along with his wife and daughter.
==Personality==
Jerry always tries to think of the best interest of the family, but his attempt to be the patriarch of the family can often be misguided by his self-centered nature. This causes him a great deal of conflict with [[Rick Sanchez (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Rick]] as his father-in-law clearly has no respect for him whatsoever.
