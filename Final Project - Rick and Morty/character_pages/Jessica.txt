She is a popular girl in [[Morty Smith]]'s math class with whom he desires to be in a romantic relationship. Much to Morty's dismay, she is frequently in a relationship with [[Brad]], though she experiences difficulties with him and the two have been shown to have an on-again-off-again relationship.

==Appearance==
Jessica is a pretty young teenage girl with shoulder-length, ginger hair who stands half a head taller than [[Morty Smith]]. Day to day, she wears a pale cyan headband, a form-fitting, periwinkle polo, a box-pleated, mauve miniskirt, pale cyan mid-calf socks, and plain white loafers.

In "[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]" when she attends the Flu Season Dance, she wears a cyan headband with a teal flower on the right side, a strapless, cyan dress with a sweetheart neckline and a knee-length basque skirt (likely filled out with tulle layers or a crinoline petticoat/underskirt) cinched at the waist by a broad teal sash tied into a darker teal bow at center-back, a pale pink corsage with a hot pink band on her right wrist (likely given to her by her date, Brad), and cyan, pointed-toe high heels.

In "[[Ricksy Business]]" when she attends Summer's and Rick's house party, she wears a dark magenta headband, a strapless, dark magenta dress with a sweetheart neckline, and a mini-length, narrow basque skirt cinched at the waist by a thin black belt with a square, silver buckle, and dark magenta, round-toe pumps.

In "[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]" when Morty takes her to a school dance, she wears a lavender headband, a halter-strapped, lavender dress with a sweetheart neckline and a knee-length basque skirt (either unlined or filled out thinly with tulle layers) cinched at the waist by a bisected, paler lavender belt, and paler lavender, square-toe pumps.

For all of her outfits, her make-up appears to just be black or dark mascara and pale pink lip gloss.

==Personality==
Jessica's part in the series thus far has been as [[Morty Smith]]'s love interest; however, she has expressed some level of depth. Her most exposing time on screen is in "[[Ricksy Business]]," where she has a brief interlude from the party alone with Morty. This ultimately leads nowhere and Jessica remains a seemingly shallow character with plenty of potential for more development. However, there are scenarios showing that she is a well-meaning and considerably nice person. She never shows any contempt for Morty and even greets him warmly despite their different popularity status. She also helps Rick track down Morty to bring him back to his normal self in "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]," and then shows concern after the process. Prior in the same episode, when Jessica gets turned off by Morty's annoying confidence due to his detoxification, she tries to get out of the date by pretending to receive an emergency text, but realizes she is being rude and instead politely tells him why they will not work out.

She seems to consider abnormal things interesting, remaining surprisingly calm in various situations that would drive others crazy. In [[Pilot]], she is impressed with Morty for coming into the cafeteria through a portal, and in [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez|"Big Trouble In Little Sanchez"]] when Morty tells her that tiny Rick is his grandpa in the body of a teenager, her only response is, "Cool."

After spending hundreds of years in the Narnia dimension frozen in a state of conscious cryostasis in "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]", Jessica takes on a distinctly philosophical mindset about her place in the universe and time. It remains to be seen how this has affected her overall personality as she is only shown in the immediate aftermath of getting rescued, but she seems to now think of herself as a "time god."

==Biography==
[[Morty Smith]] has an obvious crush on Jessica, but she doesn't acknowledge Morty frequently. While they aren't friends per se, Jessica is genuinely nice to Morty and seems not to mind his company, even going with him to the school dance and grinding with him in [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez|"Big Trouble In Little Sanchez"]]. So far, she has only spoken to him directly three times. In the [[Pilot]], when [[Rick Sanchez]] and Morty escape from [[Intergalactic Customs]], the duo crash into her table. Morty and she have a brief exchange before Rick rips him away. In "[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]", a simulated, holographic projection of Jessica attempts to seduce Morty in exchange for the recipe for [[concentrated dark matter]]. In [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez|"Big Trouble In Little Sanchez"]], Jessica questions Morty on his relation to the now younger Rick, and the two are later seen slow dancing together at the school dance. Jessica also has a few minor mentions in [[Mortynight Run|"Mortynight Run"]], once as a [foot related] thought read from Morty's mind, and a second time as a phase of a shape-shifting flower in the musical number [[Goodbye Moonmen|"Goodbye Moonmen"]].

Jessica plays a fairly significant role in the episode "[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]". Morty uses a "love potion" concocted by Rick to attempt to make Jessica fall in love with him, in which the potion succeeds. However, the strand of the Flu Virus that Jessica carries infects the school and eventually the world. This version of Jessica is last seen in mutated [[Cronenbergs|"Cronenberg"]] form before Rick and Morty flee to [[Replacement Dimension|replacement dimension]], almost identical to Earth [[Dimension C-137]].

Morty and Jessica's longest time spent in conversation is seen in "[[Ricksy Business]]" immediately after Jessica is seen irritated by Brad's actions. Morty comforts her, then proceeds to take her on a tour of Rick's garage. He begins to tell her of his adventures when they are interrupted by [[Squanchy]]. Jessica is seen leaving with Brad to attend the after party together.

In the post-ending credits epilogue for the episode "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]", Jessica made a non-speaking cameo in [[Mr. Goldenfold|Mr. Goldenfold's]] class, looking back in shock when Morty transformed into a car.

In the third season episode "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", Morty insists that any future daughters he has will be attractive because Jessica will be their mother, proving once again his hopeless crush on her.

Jessica gets a major role in "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]." She breaks up with Brad and Morty wants to use this opportunity to ask her out; however, due to his insecurities, he almost completely blows it. He is saved when Rick interrupts and drags Morty into an exhausting adventure which causes both to decide to take a break. As a result, Morty is detoxified while on a vacation afterwards, which removes his insecurities. Afterward, Morty finally asks Jessica for a date, but after becoming intimidated by his newfound confidence she eventually leaves saying that it's not going to work out and that "he'd get bored with her," though thanks to Morty's new attitude he is unfazed by the matter. Jessica later helps Rick to track down Morty so Rick can inject Morty with his toxins. She denies that she did this out of any deep affection for Morty, saying that she only did it for Rick's sake, which causes Rick to insult her and drives the two to fight over who really wanted the old Morty back. Jessica is later seen talking with her friends who tease her about going out with Brad again, which a disappointed Morty hears. Before he can get dragged off on another adventure, however, Jessica calls out to him to let him know that she is glad to have him back.

In the fourth season episode "[[Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat]]", Jessica becomes a major focus for Morty's story branch, in which Morty becomes motivated to follow a path toward a future where he sees that he dies peacefully with Jessica telling him that she loves him – a future seen while holding a Forbodulon Prime death crystal. The cold opening shows a photo of her on Morty's smartphone from her Instagram page, looking somewhat vapid in a selfie at her grandmother's wake to show off the tacky Margaritaville souvenir necklace her grandmother left to her. After Morty goes on a rampage wreaking utter havoc on the town the next day and getting away with it to ensure his perceived best destiny, Jessica invites Morty out to see her and her friends' skinny dipping, but he declines saying "let's meet together again in our forties", following the visions the death crystal gives him, leaving her somewhat bewildered at his actions, yet still mildly admiring of him. At the epilogue of the episode, it is revealed that the vision is the culmination of Morty going into a future where in fact, he never hooks up with Jessica, and dies alone, where Jessica has pursued a career in hospice care and follows her dreams of comforting those passing on alone at their last moments, leaving an overhearing Morty feeling stupid for being lead on by the clairvoyant predictions of the death crystal he used.

In the fifth season premiere "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]", Morty calls Jessica to admit his feelings for her when he thinks he is about to die, remarking the timing never worked out. To his shock, Jessica replies that she was always interested and suggests they watch a movie that night. Morty quickly agrees, but their date night comes into conflict with Rick's dinner with Mr. Nimbus. Morty's repeated attempts to get wine for Jessica from an alternate dimension with a faster timeline (a "Narnia" dimension) initially put her off, thinking he's busy, but during a lull, in the night the two finally kiss for the first time. However, when the other dimension sends in a soldier to kill Morty, Jessica's attempt to interfere leads to her getting sucked into the dimension, where she is frozen in time as a lure for Morty. After she is rescued with the help of Rick and Mr. Nimbus, Morty tries to continue their date. However, due to spending hundreds of years in a state of conscious cryostasis in this dimension, Jessica comes out with a changed perspective on life and the universe and tells a crestfallen Morty that they should just be friends. She walks off into the night, though not before loudly rejecting a guy who tries to pick her up by telling him she's a time god.

==Relationships==
===[[Morty Smith|Morty]]===
At the beginning of the series, Jessica was almost entirely oblivious to Morty's existence, only knowing his name at first sight of him. The two had brief exchanges over the season, most sparked by Rick in some way or another. In the [[season 1]] finale, "[[Ricksy Business]]," he came close to confessing his feelings to her, but was interrupted by [[Squanchy]]. Nothing is known of the details of the pair's relationship; however, the latest appearance of the two was in the episode "[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]", where they were seen slow dancing together, as a couple attending the school dance.

Their relationship is a major plot point of "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]." Morty wants to ask her for a date when he finds out that Jessica is now single. He eventually can't say a word due to his insecurities and is dragged to another adventure by Rick. After the adventure proves to be very long and exhausting (and resulting in their closest brush with death), Rick and Morty go to an intergalactic day spa and get their toxins removed from their bodies. This includes all of Morty's insecurities, making him confident enough to finally ask Jessica for a date. Jessica seems not to like Morty's new persona and leaves. Morty is then seen hanging out with different women. She later calls Morty and tells him she misses him. This call helps Rick track down Morty and inject him with his toxins, returning Morty to normal. By the end of the episode, she is talking about going out to dinner with Brad, making Morty depressed. She cheers Morty up when she tells him it's good to have him back. The episode suggests that she might have started to genuinely care for Morty, at least as a friend.

In "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]", Morty calls Jessica when he thinks he will die and apologizes for not making a move but she shocks Morty by revealing she has been interested in him for some time and suggests they go on an actual date. Despite multiple setbacks, the date leads to the two of them kissing, although any progress in their relationship is ruined when Jessica is sucked into an alternate dimension with a faster timeline and left frozen in stasis while remaining fully conscious for hundreds of years. She comes out of it deciding that she and Morty should just be friends, much to his sadness as he guesses they missed their moment but she then replies that there will be more moments for both of them in the future implying that their interactions with each other will continue. It is unknown if she will retain this attitude in future episodes.

===[[Brad]]===
Jessica and Brad are assumed to be dating throughout most of the series; however, Jessica is blatantly unhappy in this relationship. This illustrates a level of depth to her character even early on in the story. They fight consistently throughout the series and Jessica was last seen romantically with Morty. It can be assumed that Brad and Jessica have had a falling out by this point; however, no information is given. It is revealed in "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]" that they have broken up.

===[[Rick Sanchez]]===
Jessica has had a very few brief connections with Rick over the course of the series so far. In "[[Ricksy Business]]", she was intrigued by Rick's inventions. In "[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]", much like all the other students, was amazed at how cool of a student Rick had become as "[[Tiny Rick]]."

She helps Rick to find Morty in "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]." She denies that she was extremely worried about Morty, and claims that she only did it because Rick was drunk-dialing her into it, though this seems unconvincing as Rick and Jessica squabble about who wanted to find Morty, suggesting that her persona might be similar to Rick's to some degree.

===[[Grace Smith]]===
Grace pushes Jessica to do things to make her popular; she cares a great deal about how the rest of the school sees her and Jessica. She does not appear to be a good influence on Jessica, as she convinces Jessica to act differently solely so people will look up to and like her. Jessica likes her because she thinks she has good advice and she looks at the girl as someone from whom she can seek guidance. In reality, Jessica doesn't care about being popular: she only acts the way she does because her friend encourages her to do so.

==Trivia==
*Jessica vaguely resembles [[Kari Wahlgren]] (Jessica's voice actress). She also shares the same first initial of her last name with her.
*In the episode "[[Mortynight Run]]", it is hinted that [[Morty Smith]] has a foot fetish as [[Fart]]'s telepathic ability reveals Morty's subconscious thoughts at the time were of "Jessica's feet."
*In the episode "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", it is revealed that Morty is so infatuated with Jessica that he believes they will one day have at least one child together and that, should they have a daughter, she will be very attractive due to Jessica's genes.
*In the episode "[[Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat]]", Jessica's Instagram profile name is shown to be YAAAAAASsica❤, an amalgamation of her name with the slang term "[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yasss yaaas]".
*Jessica appears to have an interest in working as a nurse or in hospice when she's an adult, as shown in "[[Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat]]." In addition, a poster bearing the image of a pink caduceus staff (the symbol of medicine and healthcare services), is shown in her room in the episode "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]."
*Jessica spends an indeterminate though lengthy period of time frozen in a conscious cryostasis during the episode "Mort Dinner Rick Andre," which appears to have caused a shift in her temperament and perception of the world.
*In "Mort Dinner Rick Andre," Jessica's line questioning: "Was I just the object in another story? Is that all I ever was? Could I be more?" is likely a comical meta-reference to the fact that the inclusion of Jessica's character in the show revolves entirely around her position as Morty's crush- a common trope in TV and media.
*Her longest episode was in "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]"
*In Jessica's quote included in the "[[Rick and Morty Character Guide]]", she cites a portion of [[wikipedia:Sylvia Plath|Sylvia Plath]]'s "[[wikipedia:The_Bell_Jar|The Bell Jar]]": ''"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story"''.
