'''Jesus Christ''' has a cameo appearance in ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]]'' as a caricature of himself on a story-train constructed entirely of a literal story device.

==Biography==
This version of Jesus is based on the religious figure found in the Christian Bible. Whilst he seems to posses the same power of his Biblical counterpart, as well as many more not found within the book, he remains unique due to the fact he's aware of his existence as a purely fictional interpretation. 

==Appearance==
Jesus' appearance seems to stem from his stereotypical appearance from both religious paintings and interpretations found within pop culture. As such, he wears robes, which cover his incredibly muscular body, as well as fair skin, long flowing hair and a beard. This Jesus was introduced into a story by Rick, so it could be assumed his appearance is based on how Rick interprets Jesus.
