'''Jon''' is a parody on the [[w:c:garfield:Jon Arbuckle|character of the same name]] from the ''[[Wikipedia:Garfield|Garfield]]'' comics. He is a character on the [[Gazorpazorp]]'s TV Show, ''[[Gazorpazorpfield]]''.

==History==
Jon is the owner of [[Gazorpazorpfield (Character)|Gazorpazorpfield]].

==Trivia==
* Despite being called "human" by Gazorpazorpfield, he has two extra pairs of arms like a Gazorpian.
** He is, however, a fictional cartoon character. So, the Gazorpians may have drawn him to look like this on purpose.
* In the comics he has four fingers, but in the cartoon he has five.
