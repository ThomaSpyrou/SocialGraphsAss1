'''Josiah''' is a construction worker, who fell victim to the [[Lovefinderrz]] app and started dating [[Priest Witherspoon]] on impulse.

Josiah makes a brief cameo in [[Forgetting Sarick Mortshall]], where he is fixing a power line but is attacked by crows causing him to fall out of the cherrypicker.
