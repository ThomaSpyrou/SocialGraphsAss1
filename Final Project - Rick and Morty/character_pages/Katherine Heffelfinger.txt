The original Katherine might have became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

In the episode "[[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]", Morty had a huge rage out, and he lashed out at Summer, going on a tangent about how TV producers don't care about her feelings, and would rather make their media interesting instead of inoffensive. Rick responded by saying "Jeez, Morty. I take it Katherine Hefflefinger hasn't texted you back yet?" to which Morty responded, saying "I don't wanna talk about it."
==Trivia==
*Katherine is Morty's fourth love interest in the series, following [[Jessica]], [[Annie]], and [[Arthricia]].
