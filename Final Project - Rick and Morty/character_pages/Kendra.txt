==Biography==
Sometime before the events of "[[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]]", '''Kendra''' was a GoTron pilot but abandoned her GoTron ferret for unknown reasons. In [[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]], Kendra was in the limo where [[Morty Smith|Morty]] was taken hostage and tried to get Morty to betray his family and work with the anime pilots. Morty declines and narrowly escapes the limo before it crashes into a rock. Kendra is injured and later hired by [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] to pilot the GoGoGoTron but once the GoGoGoTron is ready, Kendra betrays Rick and attacks him, along with the other anime pilots. They almost succeed, but [[Naruto Smith|Naruto]] shows up and destroys the robot, causing the anime pilots to get sucked into space or hung by wires. Kendra holds on to the GoGoGoTron while being surprised that Rick's family has a giant incest baby, before being kicked by Rick and being sucked into outer space.
