'''Khlorgg''' is a [[Crittendians|crittendian]] who used to roam on his home planet searching for blood to consume. Not long after, Khlorgg was forced to make a deal the Galactic Federation, effectively giving away his free will. He was relocated to planet [[Earth]] and set to work at a fastfood restaurant, Wholesome Delight. Still pent up with rage, he spends his days getting angry at rude and messy customers who he wants to crush (one of whom is [[Jerry Smith]]).  Its is presumed that he is currently back in his homeworld after the events of The Rickshank Redemption as the collapse of the Galactic Federation most likely caused Khlorgg's deal with them to become null and void and as a result regain his free will. <ref name = "Hhlorgg crush">{{cite web | title = FOUR HUMAN KHLORGG WANT CRUSH | url = http://fedconnect.galacticfederation.com/post/158133968659/four-human-khlorgg-want-crush}}</ref>
