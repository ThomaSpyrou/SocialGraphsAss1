{{quote|Pluto's a fucking planet, BITCH!|King Flippy Nips on [[Jerry Smith|Jerry's]] opinion about Pluto not being a dwarf planet|Something Ricked This Way Comes}}

'''King Flippy Nips''' is the ruler of Pluto. He first appeared in '[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]' as the central antagonist.

==Appearance==
He looks just like any other [[Plutonian]], yet with minor alterations. He wears a golden crown and a cape. He also has no aerials on his head; this is possibly the reason he is king. He is male.

==Personality==
He acts quite self-centered. He is also selfish because he knows everything his son says is real, but keeps quiet about it because he wants to stay king. He is also highly manipulative.

==Biography==
In the episode [[Something Ricked This Way Comes]], King Flippy Nips has [[Jerry]] and [[Morty]] kidnapped to Pluto because of Jerry's dedication to Pluto being a planet. He then puts Jerry in front of crowds and on TV to continue to say that Pluto is a planet, while claiming that Jerry is a real scientist. He awards Jerry with the Plutobel Prize (the highest honor reward for scientists) while keep urging Jerry to talk of how much of a planet Pluto is. 

When the plutonian police captures [[Scroopy Noopers]], King Flippy sends him to Plutanomo Bay military prison for continuing to say that Pluto is not a planet. Afterwards, while talking to Jerry about Scroopy, he let's it slip that Pluto is a celestial dwarf before correcting himself and sending Jerry off to his Plutobel Prize ceremony. When Jerry refuses to cooperate about Pluto's planet-status King Flippy rudely sends Jerry back to [[Earth]].
