}}{{Quote|It’s time for Earth brands to reach an intergalactic audience, and introduce a whole new range of products to humans.}}'''Kl’iiik Mijupsrit''' is a Grunglorkian who succeeded [[Mr. Marklovitz]] as the CEO of the advertisement agency, [[Haas & Milan]]. 

==Biography==
After being installed as CEO, Mijupsrit was responsible for a number of different successful campaigns on [[Earth]], including the use of Federation-exclusive microlasers to sear ads directly onto the consumer’s ocular orbs. He later used [[Jerry]] failed ad pitch "Hungry for Apples?", an ad which turned out to become the company's most successful ad ever; earning Kl'iiik countless awards, reconition and wealth.

It can be assumed that he left Earth shortly following the [[Blemflarck#Blemflarck Crisis|Blemflarck Crisis]]. 

==Personality==
The mug he kept on his desk points to him being a fan of [[Gazorpazorpfield]]. He did not trust his employees at Haas & Milan as he mentioned rifling through their garbage to keep tabs on employee loyalty during his interview with ''GFedToday''.
