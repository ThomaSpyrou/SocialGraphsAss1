'''Kyle''' is a minor character introduced in the episode "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy|''The Ricks Must Be Crazy'']]" who existed within [[Zeep Xanflorp|Zeep Xanflorp's]] [[Miniverse]].

==Appearance==
Like the other inhabitants of his planet, Kyle is hairless, white, and somewhat doughy in appearance. His eyes are a pale green with dark green pupils, and he wears a lab coat.

==Biography==
Kyle was a scientist who developed a "[[Teenyverse]]" similar to [[Rick|Rick's]] [[Microverse Battery|Microverse]] and Zeep's Miniverse. While the planet he showed to [[Rick]], [[Morty]], and Zeep was not yet advanced enough to be introduced to electricity, it would soon enough render Zeep's Miniverse obsolete.

When he figured out that his own universe was merely [[miniverse]] within a [[microverse]], and that he existed only to be exploited, he became distraught, recalling that he missed his father's funeral to work on his own microverse. He committed suicide by flying his ship into a cliff, leaving Rick, Morty and Zeep stranded within his Teenyverse.

==Trivia==
* In "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]," [[Mr. Nimbus]] mentioned another "Kyle" who was a companion of Rick that Nimbus knew before Morty. This "Kyle" is also referenced in "[[Forgetting Sarick Mortshall]]", where Rick spins a "Wheel of Better Things than Morty" with "Kyle 2.0" on it.
