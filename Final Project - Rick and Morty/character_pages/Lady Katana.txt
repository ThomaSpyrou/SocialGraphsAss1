She was never seen, but was mentioned in "[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]". She appears as a stereotypical Western racial caricature of an Asian person with a long ponytail, wearing a purple ninja outfit and wielding a katana. She also appears to have robotic limbs, suggesting she is either an android, a cyborg or has limb prostheses.

==Trivia==
*She is a parody of [[Wikipedia:Katana (comics)|Katana]] from ''[[Wikipedia:Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.
