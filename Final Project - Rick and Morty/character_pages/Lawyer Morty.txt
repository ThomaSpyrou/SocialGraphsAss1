'''Lawyer Morty''' is a Morty who poses as a lawyer at the [[Council of Ricks]].

==Biography==
He is put on [[Morty Smith|Morty]] and [[Summer Smith|Summer's]] side for their quarrel against the Council of Ricks in ''[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]'', where he is shown to be less of a serious lawyer and only there because "he's fun". He apparently has a pog collection.

In the same episode, many Mortys are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Lawyer Morty is one of the Mortys who died.
