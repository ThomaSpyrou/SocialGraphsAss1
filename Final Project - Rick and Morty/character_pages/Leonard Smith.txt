'''Leonard Smith''' is the husband of [[Joyce Smith]], the father of [[Jerry Smith]], the brother or brother-in-law of the [[Unnamed Uncle]], the father-in-law of [[Beth Smith]], and the pahuternal grandfather of [[Summer Smith]] and [[Morty Smith]]. He appears in the episode "[[Anatomy Park (episode)|Anatomy Park]]". Like his wife, he is a swinger and participates in a three-way cuckold relationship with his wife and [[Jacob Philip]] where he mainly participates as a [[wikipedia:Voyeurism|voyeur]].

==Biography==
Leonard made his first appearance in the episode "[[Anatomy Park (episode)|Anatomy Park]]", where [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] wanted to have a traditional Christmas holiday and kept pushing his family to be lively for when his parents visited. He and [[Joyce Smith|Joyce]] visited the Smith family for Christmas. They also brought along a man named [[Jacob Philip|Jacob]] with them. They explained to their son Jerry that Jacob was a motivational man who lived with them to help bring joy back into their marriages. Jacob's main purpose was to have sex with Joyce on account of Leonard's impotence. Leonard would also watch them doing it from a closet, and according to him, almost always dressed as Superman. Jerry was shocked and he felt very miserable. He ended up hating his parents for this.
