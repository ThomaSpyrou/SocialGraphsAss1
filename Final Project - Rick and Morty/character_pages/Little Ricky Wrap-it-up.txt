He, along with other versions of the Smith family, was invited by Rick C-137 on a cook-off to discuss the repairment of their GoTrons. When the meeting concluded, he wrapped it up by raising the wineglasses. 

In the families' secret club, after an attack on an incomplete GoTron, he got crushed to death by a brick wall.
