==Trivia==
*Loggins Attila's design is a reference to John "Hannibal" Smith, from The A-Team.
*Him resembling a crocodile may be a reference to how crorocdiles are mistaken for logs.
*His name could have originated from a couple of sources.
**One of them being that actor, Kenny Loggins, was in a band called "Gator".
**Another far-fetched theory is that it is a reference to the FX series ''Archer''. Sterling Archer's favorite actor is Burt Reynolds, who plays Gator McKlusky and his favorite musician is Kenny Loggins. The resemblance between Loggins and Gator McKlusky is uncanny.
