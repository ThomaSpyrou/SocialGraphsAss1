He is later found, while bathing and scrubbed by [[Taint Washer]] and [[Genital Washer]], by Morty with Armothy and starts making frightened excuses for his actions. He is strangled by Armothy while Morty and Rick watches, but Armothy disappears before Henderfinger fully dies. While lying in his bathtub, Rick takes Morty hand and places it around the Lord's throat. Together they strangle him to death.
