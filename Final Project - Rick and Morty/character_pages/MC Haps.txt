==Biography==
===Dimension C-137===
MC Haps (C-137) first appeared as the entertainment at the ''Flu Season Dance'' at [[Harry Herpson High School]] in "[[Rick Potion 9]]". He performed the song "[[Flu Hatin' Rap]]" with a backup band until he got infected with Morty's [[Love Potion]]. He then switched over to sing about his love for [[Morty]]. Presumably, he was turned into a [[Mantis-people|Mantis-person]] by Rick's first antidote, and then into a [[Cronenbergs|Cronenberg]] after Rick's second. He may or may not have been killed by the remaining Smiths in this dimension.

===Replacement dimension===
The same things happened to MC Haps in the [[Replacement dimension]]; only in this dimension, he and the rest of humanity was eventually cured by Rick.

In "[[Big Trouble in Little Sanchez]]", he was at the house party hosted by Summer and Tiny Rick. He later played the music at the ''The Big Dance'' at Harry Herpson High School, this time under the name "''DJ Intelligence''", and joined in to boo Summer after she got Tiny Rick expelled. 

He also attended Rick and [[Summer]]'s party in "[[Ricksy Business]]". His crew would later be part of [[The Rick Dance]] while being in the [[Testicle Monster Dimension]]. After Morty announced the end of the party, and the house was returned to Earth, he joined the rest of the guests to [[Squanchy]]'s place to continue the party.

MC Haps was again invited to Rick's party in "[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]" and enjoyed the performance by [[Logic]].
