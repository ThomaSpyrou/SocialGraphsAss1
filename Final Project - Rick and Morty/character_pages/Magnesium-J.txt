'''Magnesium-J''' is an Alphabetrian royal figure of a castle on [[Alphabetrium]]. He served alongside [[Hydrogen-F]] and [[Helium-Q]] to govern the planet. 

==Biography==
The Alphabetrians turned [[Ice-T|Water-T]] into Ice-T when he refused to care about anyone, and banished him from their world. He would only be able to return if he learned to care about other people.

After Ice-T helped save [[Earth]] from the [[Cromulons]], he returned to his home planet to meet with the elders. {{PAGENAME}} and his fellow elders had heard of Ice-T's feat and welcomed him home. {{PAGENAME}} decided that Ice-T's exiled could now end, and granted him back his original form. This was immediately followed by the [[Numbericons]] attacking Alphabetrium, causing a large rock to fall down on Helium-Q and kill him. Water-T drew his guns and charged the Numbericons to avenge his father's death.
