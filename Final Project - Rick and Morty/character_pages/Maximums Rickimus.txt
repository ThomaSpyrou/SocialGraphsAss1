'''Maximums Rickimus''' was one of the members of the now defunct [[Council of Ricks]]. He was killed by [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]."

==Biography==
In "''[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]''", Maximums Rickimus appears alongside his fellow council-members, [[Riq IV]], [[Rick Prime]], [[Quantum Rick]], [[Zeta Alpha Rick]], and [[Ricktiminus Sancheziminius]], accusing [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] for the murder of 37 alternate Ricks, including [[The Scientist Formerly Known as Rick]]. They sentenced Rick C-137 to the machine of unspeakable doom, to which he steals a portal gun and escapes from the Citadel.

After the real perpetrator, [[Evil Rick]], was beaten to death by the group of enslaved Mortys, the Council of Ricks shows up to escort the Rick-less Mortys back to their respective dimensions. The Council takes C-137 Rick and Morty back to the Citadel, and officially apologize to Rick for accusing him of the murders. They even offer him a coupon for a free Morty, should anything ever happen to his, which Rick accepts while Morty's back is turned.

In "''[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]''", the Council of Ricks hold [[Morty]] and [[Summer]] captive after sending [[SEAL Team Ricks]] to assassinate Rick C-137. After C-137 teleported the entire Citadel back into the middle of the Federation prison, a heated battle broke out between the two sides. Rick C-137 infiltrated the Council chamber and shot Maximums Rickimus in the chest, killing him.
