The '''Alien Parasites''' are an unnamed group of aliens who invade and conquer planets by shape-shifting into the forms of various beings such as humans, aliens, animals, historical figures etc. and taking up a persona of them.

==History==
When alien parasites arrive on a planet, they implant people's minds with false memories of invented characters being people such as friends, family members, etc. Once they have multiplied enough, they use this to take over the planet and enslave the race. They invaded [[Earth]] and confronted the [[Smith Family|Smith family]].

{{Quote|2 = Rick explaining the parasites|"These telepathic little bastards embed themselves into memories and multiply to take over planets!  They're disgusting, so be careful of any wacky or zany characters that pop up".|3 = Total Rickall}}

As [[Morty]] discovered, the parasites only implant perfect, friendly and happy memories into their victims. This means if someone cannot remember any bad memories of another person, the latter could be a parasite.

They also seem capable of suppressing other memories, particularly ones contradictory to memories they have implanted. One of the characters created, [[Sleepy Gary]], replaces [[Jerry]] as [[Beth Smith|Beth's]] husband, and for this to work any memories of Jerry as Beth's husband would need to be suppressed. When [[Rick]] threatened to shoot [[Summer Smith|Summer]], [[Sleepy Gary]] stood in the way, shouting 'That is my daughter.'.
