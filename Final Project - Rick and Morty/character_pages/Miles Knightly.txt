'''Miles Knightly''' is a famous "heist artist" who challenged [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] in a fight he was not prepared for.



==Appearance==
Miles Knightly has light red skin, blue to purple sleeked hair, pointy ears, a monobrow like Rick's, a chopped in the middle mustache, green eyes, and a yellow leather jacket. He also has a bronze skeleton, which was only known after all his skin and limbs were ripped off of him.

==Personality==
He was a polite if arrogant man who believed in the heist genre as an art. When he was instantly defeated by Rick within seconds of his heist-off starting he was genuinely stunned which means he was quite confident in his heisting abilities until Rick completely showed him up.

==Biography==
Rick and Morty were going on a classic epic adventure until Rick finds a calling card that makes him remember Miles Knightly exists, which threw him into a rage and caused him to go to Miles' Heist-Con and try to show him up. He does exactly that and accidentally gets Miles horrifically dismembered and stolen when he told the entire audience to steal every square inch of Heist-Con.

==Trivia==
* His appearance bears a significant similarity to DC Comics character, Sinestro.
* He also bears a resemblance to Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury, even wearing one of Mercury's iconic outfits.
