He appeared in "[[Pilot]]".


==Biography==
Mitch appears for the first time in the [[Pilot]], where he is seen at [[Frank Palicky]]'s funeral organized by [[Summer Smith (C-137)|Summer Smith]], suggesting that he and Frank were friends or that Mitch valued him, the boy was crying over Frank's death, while [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry]] and [[Beth Smith (C-137)|Beth]] (Summer and Morty's parents) together with the [[Principal Vagina]], they looked confused.

The original Mitch presumably became a Cronenberg inÂ [[Dimension C-137]].

An alternative version of Mitch appears in "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]", the boy reminded [[Morty Smith|Morty]] (who was currently deprived of all [[Toxic Morty|negativity]] because of an alien spa) of how he couldn't play the trombone yesterday and then proves he learned now, by playing a tune. He then thanked Morty and the boy gave him the same advice he did yesterday, saying "the music was inside him the whole time".
