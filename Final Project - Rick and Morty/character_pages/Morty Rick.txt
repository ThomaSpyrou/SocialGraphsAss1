In the same episode, many Mortys are killed when the [[Citadel of Ricks]] is transported into a prison of the [[Galactic Federation]], it is unknown if Morty Rick is one of the Mortys who died.

==Appearance==
Morty Rick wears Morty's clothes with Rick's labcoat. He shares his head shape and facial structure with Morty, while his hairstyle and physique, along with hair and skin colors, are shared with Rick.

==Trivia==
*The [[RickShank Rickdemption (Game)]] identifies him as "Scientist Morty".
*Morty Rick's existence has led to a minor fan theory that all Mortys who get to live out the full human life expectancy actually become a Rick. This theory is supported by [[Tiny Rick]]'s hair color, the complete absence of any explicitly adult Mortys and the lack of a partner for this character.
