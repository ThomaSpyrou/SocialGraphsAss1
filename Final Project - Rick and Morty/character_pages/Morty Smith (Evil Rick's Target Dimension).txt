In the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], Morty and his family were sitting around the table, eating breakfast. While he was eating, [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty]] opened a portal, walked into the room, they tranquilized the boy himself as well as shot to his grandfather Rick, and took the boy with them. After they brought the boy back into their dimension, they put him in a dungeon, where they would soon torture him. Later in the episode, Morty (C-137) came to save all of the other Mortys, including this one, and set them free to live their lives in freedom.
