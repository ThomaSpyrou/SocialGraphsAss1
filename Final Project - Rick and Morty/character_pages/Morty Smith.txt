'''Mortimer "Morty" Smith Sr.''' is one of the two titular main protagonists (alongside [[Rick Sanchez]]) of ''[[Rick and Morty]]''.

He is the grandson of [[Rick]] and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends [[Harry Herpson High School]] along with his sister, [[Summer]].<ref name="Pilot">[[Pilot]]</ref> At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. However, after going on many so-called adventures with Rick, Morty has seemingly become more confident and his own person<ref>[[The Old Man and the Seat]] (Probably the best example of a Rickless adventure)</ref>, independent from Rick, rather than a mere sidekick.

He is voiced by [[Justin Roiland]].
==Biography==
Currently, Morty is around 14 years old. He first met his grandfather, Rick Sanchez, when the latter moved into his home after supposedly being absent for 20 years. However, it was revealed that Rick is originally from Dimension C-137 and, after losing his wife and daughter, eventually moved into Morty's dimension to live with an adult version of Beth. However, curiously enough, it has been shown Rick knew Morty when he was a baby.

In "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]", one of Rick's happy memories of Morty was picking him up as a baby. In "[[Get Schwifty]]", a picture on [[Birdperson]]'s wall depicted Rick holding a baby, who, although had an ambiguous identity, was very likely Morty. It was originally assumed these babies were our Morty, but the revelation that Rick only just met Morty shortly before the beginning of the series contradicts this. It's possible the baby Rick picked up was an alternate version of Morty or Rick dropped in on this version of the Smith (who resided within the Cronenberged Dimension; our Morty's original home) family to meet him before leaving once again.

In "[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]", [[Beth Smith|Beth]] accidentally admitted that when Morty was a baby, [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] filled Morty with his own insecurities, making him the anxious teenager we see in the series. In the pilot episode, Morty's parents insist that he has some sort of learning disability. Rick later states Morty's low intelligent masks Rick's high intelligence, acting as a camouflage that prevents Rick's incredible intelligence from being tracked. 

In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" it is revealed that most Mortys were bred at The Citadel in order to serve Ricks, as well as act as camouflage. Whilst it's never explicitly stated that our Morty was among the Mortys who were created at The Citadel, Rick alludes to it, telling Morty "Jeez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness." However, it was also shown that Ricks manipulated circumstances for different versions of Jerry and Beth to meet, which would lead to them conceiving Morty in the future. This could also mean Morty ''was'' born, but only via interference from the Citadel. Rick's aforementioned dialogue could contradict this second possibility.    

Despite it being alluded to, it can be reasonably assumed Morty was not created at the Citadel and was instead born naturally. The Smith family all seem to have memories of Morty growing up in their home<ref>"Morty, no offence, but a drawing of me you made when you were eight isn't gonna make me feel like any less of an accident" - '''Summer''' "[[Rixty Minutes]]" ''(Take note that despite being from a different dimension, the timeline played out the same except the original Morty from the Replacement Dimension dying, so it still holds up)''


"[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]" - Jerry recalls a story of toddler Morty throwing his underwear out of the window.


"[[Pilot]]" - Morty is confirmed to have been at school long before Rick showed up. Clone Mortys appear to be handed off to Ricks the moment they're "born".</ref>, including Morty's original family from the Cronenberged Dimension.  This is noteworthy, as it appears that once grown at the Citadel, Mortys are immediately given to a Rick as a sidekick. This would also disprove Morty being born through interference by the Ricks, as this was only done to create more Mortys for the same purpose.    

==Appearance==
[[file:MortyTransparent.png|thumb|100px]]
Morty is a young teenage boy. He has short brown hair that he wears straight and neatly combed around his head. Morty's head is round and roughly in the shape and size of a circle, unlike many other characters in the show. He also doesn't have a visible neck. He typically wears a yellow shirt, blue pants, and white shoes.  

Morty also has a pronounced stutter (even when calm) and his voice constantly breaks due his effects of puberty. However, as the series has progressed, Morty's stutter seems to occur less frequently.   

==Personality==
Morty is a young, good-natured, and impressionable boy who can be somewhat easily manipulated. He has been described as 'challenged' and has difficulty in school. He also has a pronounced stutter. Despite his apparent lack of intellect, Morty has shown to be a good listener and follows directions well. These traits make him the perfect sidekick to [[Rick]].<ref name="Pilot" /> He is interested in [[Jessica]], a student in his math class. Like many boys his age, he spends a good deal of time masturbating.

Morty may sometimes act spineless, but he has shown bravery and quick-wittedness in the face of adversity, such as leading the extraction effort out of [[Anatomy Park (Location)|Anatomy Park]], and using a pair of grappling boots to escape the guards in [[Intergalactic Customs]].<ref name="Anatomy Park" /> Morty is also quite responsible for his age, refusing to kill an alien child in the episode "[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]".

While Rick, Beth, and Jerry have all expressed their belief that Morty is unintelligent, there is substantial evidence to the contrary. When the group at Anatomy Park are attacked by [[Gonorrhea]], he comes up with the idea to exploit the gas building up in the body to defeat the disease. He is able to grasp complex concepts, such as the multiverse of infinite realities, when Rick explains them to him, and is quick to notice Rick's hypocrisy regarding the morality of his microverse in "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]." His hidden intelligence also continues to be an asset in season 2. Impressively, Morty is able to distract [[Fart]], a being capable of reading minds, by requesting that he sing. This gives Morty time to kill him with an antimatter gun, clearly surprising the telepathic being. In "[[Total Rickall]]," Morty is the first to realize that the alien parasites are only capable of creating positive memories. He was also able to, while inside the Teenyverse, find the Tree People, be accepted into their group, learn their language and culture, and work his way up the ranks until he had the ability to command them, all within, from their perspective according to Rick, a few months. 

In "[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]"  showed that Morty is well versed in high-tech technology, he decided to defuse a [[Neutrino Bomb|neutrino bomb]] capable of destroying an entire planet and coped with it perfectly, but Rick still helped him to defuse it to the end. Most likely he was taught to do it by Rick or himself. In "[[Forgetting Sarick Mortshall]]" Morty created a portal fluid, based on soda from the remains of the original [[Bootleg Portal Fluid|portal fluid]], with this version of the portal fluid, the portals function, but not properly and cannot close, due to his negligence, Morty could in fact ruin himself, for one [[Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick|Rick]] from [[the Citadel]] made a toxic version of the liquid and died from it ("[[Tales From the Citadel]]"), his math was not correct, even Rick himself later told Morty that such a liquid was toxic. 

In the same episode, Morty accidentally poured a version of his portal fluid into his palm and a portal opened to one man - [[Nick]], who was Rick's former partner, Morty became friends with him, but then betrayed him as Nick turned out to be a dangerous psychopath, and after Morty's betrayal, Nick was going to kill him and began to choke Morty right next to the train, Morty and Nick were connected by portals, therefore  Morty decided to get rid of him in an ingenious way, he cuts off his hand with the portal under the train wheel and drops it into the portal that was in Nick's thigh, creating a singularity that destroys it. Despite this, he thinks poorly of his own intelligence, referring to Jerry and himself as "idiots" when [[Scroopy Noopers]] questions the intelligence of the members of the Smith Family in "[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]." This is probably because of his impressionable nature; since Rick and his parents tell Morty he's stupid, and because he doesn't perform well in school, he has a low opinion of himself.

Despite his malleable nature, Morty has the strength to be able to stand up to Rick. In the episode "[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]", Morty directly calls out Rick on his cynical nature. He leads his own adventure with the direct goal of helping villagers.<ref name="Meeseeks and Destroy">[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]</ref> His malleable nature makes him echo Ricks words and speech, especially after Rick insults Summer, though he has a tendency to become hysterically upset at her.

Morty is shown to have repressed anger issues these anger issues have caused him to become hysterical and homicidal which is most notable seen in "[[Look Who's Purging Now]]". In "[[A Rickconvenient Mort]]" Morty killed the members of the [[Tina-Teers]], in order to free his girlfriend [[Planetina]]. To one of the members - [[Eddie]], Morty bit off his finger and used a ring of fire against him, which led to his death, after off-screen tore the meat from his head and threw the skull to his colleagues, then dealt with them by taking possession of their rings. Most likely, he inherited the mental state from his mother, because Morty is prone to sadism, and Beth in childhood was with sadistic inclinations, asked her father to do dangerous things for her to interfere with the neighbors.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Rick]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h29m33s97.png|thumb|220x220px|Morty and Rick disagreeing.]]
Rick is Morty's maternal grandfather; he and Morty have a close relationship overall. They come across more as best friends than grandson and grandfather, with Morty addressing Rick on a first-name basis and only adding the grandpa out of gratitude, respect or when he wants something from him. According to Beth, Morty doesn't have any friends, implying that Rick may be Morty's only friend. This could be a reason as to why Morty puts up with Rick's selfish and exploitative behavior.
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h33m02s175.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Morty and Rick having a good time.]]
Morty at first had a very one-sided relationship with Rick, helping him out despite usually ending up in harm's way or nearly killed. However, Morty does have his limits, as he will stand up to Rick when he is pushed over the edge - for example, when both of his legs are broken in "[[Pilot]]", or when Rick destroys the human race in "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]". Rick will help Morty out if it is beneficial to him, as in "[[Lawnmower Dog]]", in which he tricks [[Mr. Goldenfold]] into giving Morty A's in math so that Morty can help him more on his adventures. However, it is implied that Rick does indeed love Morty, as shown in "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]", when Rick starts crying at his memories of Morty, but generally he refrains from expressing it so that Morty does not become, as he puts it, "cocky".

From "[[Rick Potion No. 9]]" onwards, Morty no longer lives in his original dimension. Rick created a love potion designed to make Jessica attracted to Morty. However, it accidentally spread due to Jessica having the flu, and when Rick carelessly added various "remedies" it turned the humans of Earth into hideous mutants. The potion did not affect those closely related to Morty (up to two generations, as Rick is spared despite being Morty's grandfather and not immediate family), thus the rest of the Smith's remain unmutated. The mutants are described by Rick as "Cronenburgs" (named after Canadian horror film maker David Cronenburg). Instead of reverting the mutations himself, Rick takes him and Morty to an [[Replacement dimension|alternate dimension]] where their counterparts did, in a method undisclosed to the audience. Just before Rick and Morty arrived, their new dimension's counterparts were killed, caused by an explosion from a machine being engineered by the Rick counterpart. Rick C-137 and Morty bury their dead counterparts in the Smith's backyard, and secretly replace them.

In "[[Ricksy Business]]", after Rick and Summer both throw parties at the same time and trash their house, Morty is presented with an opportunity to permanently end all future adventures with Rick. Morty claims that he shouldn't care that he wouldn't be able to travel with Rick anymore, but still decides to have Rick fix everything, instead of leaving him passed out on the couch, implying that while Rick's actions do affect him, he would rather continue having adventures as opposed to not having them.
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h27m25s140.png|thumb|220x220px|Morty upset over Rick's hurtful words.]]
Morty thinks that Rick is "petty", and resents the fact that Rick has trouble "rolling with the punches" when put into a situation he isn't comfortable with; something that Morty does on a near-daily basis. Morty also seems to take what Rick says about him very seriously, as he becomes teary-eyed when Rick calls Morty "as dumb as he (Rick) is smart" in "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]". He is also very upset and angered at the idea that Mortys only exist to be human cloaking devices for Ricks, and resents the fact that Rick could just replace his Morty at any time with another Morty from a different reality. Despite all this, Rick still believes that Morty is "the Morty-est Morty", since he views himself as "the Rick-est Rick".

====[[Summer]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h20m34s202 (2).jpg|thumb|202x202px|Morty and Summer fist-bumping.]]
While in the [[pilot]], Morty and Summer's relationship is that of a normal younger brother and older sister, they eventually became somewhat closer. It is shown that Morty loves and respects his sister, which is most evident in "[[Rixty Minutes]]", where Morty reveals to her he isn't her "real" brother and convinces her to not move out. He also defends his sister against Rick's harsh treatment several times, becoming angry with [[Tiny Rick]] for humiliating her at the school dance in "[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]" and chastising him for saying 'fuck you' to her in "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]."

Despite their close relationship, the two have lots of bad memories of each other as seen in "[[Total Rickall]]", where Summer kicks Morty in his crotch for going in her room even though he was innocent. And when Summer enters the kitchen to find Morty masturbating in the corner.<ref name="YouTube">"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOckCULBGPk Rick & Morty - Summer catches Morty jerking off]" (YouTube)</ref>

Although she seems to envy the adventures Rick and Morty have, Summer seems to hold this more against her grandfather than Morty himself. Morty is also sickened by the sight of a dream version of Summer dressed in highly sexual clothing in "[[Lawnmower Dog]]".

====[[Jerry]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h24m07s137 (2).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Morty watching Jerry play a game on his tablet.]]
Morty has a loving but strained relationship with his father due in large part to the frequent misadventures Morty has with Rick. Because Rick often puts Morty in dangerous situations, Jerry is against his son being involved with him. His opposition to Rick bringing Morty with him is likely also a result of his own constant conflicts with Rick, as Jerry is frequently, and shamelessly insulted by Rick at any given opportunity, typically pointing out Jerry's far less than average intelligence and his less than perfect marriage to his daughter.

Morty still goes to Jerry for advice, such as when he needed romantic insight in "''[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]''", and agrees to work on his science project with him (though this is only because Beth discreetly tells Morty that Jerry is insecure with his intelligence). In many ways, their relationship is somewhat reversed from a normal father-son dynamic: Morty often acts like the mature one, pointing out that he could have been masturbating in his room when Jerry entered without warning, and sparing Jerry's feelings about Pluto not being a planet in "''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]''", whereas Jerry often acts like a child, having fits of rage over simple things like golfing, and trying to prove to others around him that Pluto is a planet. Despite everything, Morty told him that nobody does a better a job at being his father than Jerry, something that left Jerry happy.

In "[[The Old Man and the Seat]]", Morty reveals that he thinks Jerry is a loser but this was because he was upset that Jerry got him in a bad situation.

Despite this turbulent standing in "[[The Vat of Acid Episode]]", Morty can be seen happy to see Jerry in his montage. In "[[Childrick of Mort]]", Morty was annoyed by Jerry hosting a camping trip but was stunned by Summer's ballistic shouting at Jerry and defended his father. Later on, Morty realized Jerry was right about them not knowing everything. Jerry returned the sentiment by telling them they were right, something that left Morty shocked. This also caused Morty to realize how unfairly he has been treating his father.

Since then, Morty and Jerry interact better though Morty is still annoyed by his behavior but he hasn't lashed out at him. Jerry on the other hand, has noticed Morty's increasingly violent behavior after his murder of bullies and the Tina-teers in [[A Rickconvenient Mort]].

====[[Beth]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h39m10s207.png|thumb|200x200px|Morty sitting with Beth.]]
Morty respects and loves his mother very much, despite the fact that they have yet to have any meaningful interactions with each other. It is implied that Morty respects her more than his father, though he does not think that her method of parenting is very good in "[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]". Either way, he still loves his mother very much, and for Beth the feeling is mutual.

In the pilot episode, Beth expresses concern when Morty falls asleep at breakfast and asks if he is getting sick. Also in "Close Rick-counters of the Rick-kind" Beth is terrified when Morty is taken away by the Council of Ricks and yells at Jerry that their son has been abducted. In "The Wedding Squanchers" Beth is seen with her arm around Morty when they arrive at the [[Screaming Sun Earth|Screaming Sun planet]]. This shows that Beth does have a great amount of concern for her son.

In "''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]''", Beth asks Morty to let Jerry help him with his science project instead of Rick to boost his self esteem, through the phone. They seem to know and understand each other, and Jerry, very well.

[[File:S2e4 beth comforts morty.png|thumb|200x200px|Morty with his mom.]]
In "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", Morty lashes out on Beth for her distance towards him and Summer. He blames this on her relationship with Rick, telling her that she doesn't need to prove herself to be worthy of Rick's love by acting essentially just like him, as it is making her appear just as narcissistic and irresponsible. And that while she's trying to gain Rick's approval, she's hurting him and Summer. Beth institutes a change after this, acting more motherly and understanding. Morty, later in the episode, compliments her while talking to [[Ethan]], calling her a "good mom." Meaning he really appreciated her propensity to change.

Beth's awareness of her mistreatment of her children may drive her farther away from Rick, as she will likely stop trying to get him to love her, and instead find solace in her relationship with her kids, including Morty.

In "[[Morty's Mind Blowers]]", when Beth was forced to decide between Morty and Summer, she almost immediately chose Summer. Morty was so heartbroken by her response that he asked Rick to remove the memory from his mind.

During "[[A Rickconvenient Mort]]", Beth ultimately shows she does love Morty by voicing disapproval of his status with [[Planetina]] because of the age gap (despite her being unaging) and his recklessness in getting involved with her. Morty became angry with Beth after she demands Planetina leave. Morty, lashed out at her by voicing his adventures and how Beth, as well as the rest of the family doubt him and never let him be happy, leaving Beth stunned. When Morty and Planetina break up, Beth, hearing the argument, comforts a weeping Morty.

Morty is shown to have repressed anger issues these anger issues have caused him to become hysterical and homicidal which is most notable seen in "[[Look Who's Purging Now]]". In "[[A Rickconvenient Mort]]" Morty killed the members of the [[Tina-Teers]], in order to free his girlfriend [[Planetina]]. To one of the members - [[Eddie]], Morty bit off his finger and used a ring of fire against him, which led to his death, after off-screen tore the meat from his head and threw the skull to his colleagues, then dealt with them by taking possession of their rings. Most likely, he inherited the mental state from his mother, because Morty is prone to sadism, and Beth in childhood was with sadistic inclinations, asked her father to do dangerous things for her to interfere with the neighbors. In the episode "[[The ABC's of Beth]]" Beth brutally cracked down on the residents of [[Froopyland]] and killed [[Thomas Lipnip|Tommy]], she liked it.
====[[Snowball|Snuffles]]====
Snuffles was Morty's dog, first shown in "''[[Lawnmower Dog]]''". Morty always treated Snuffles, aka Snowball, with kindness, so Snuffles lets him keep his testicles and live by his side. Morty seems to support Snuffles' decision to colonize a new planet with the other intelligent dogs.

====[[Morty Jr.]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-04h45m41s73 (2).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Morty playing with Morty Jr.]]
Morty's Gazorpian son born from a Gazorpian sex robot that Rick purchased for Morty in "''[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]''". Morty had a love-hate relationship with Morty Jr. Morty wanted to keep his son safe and happy, as a result, he imprisoned him within their home for his own good, as well as for the safety of the world, due to his son's desire to murder everyone he saw, and wanting to conquer the planet. When Rick tried to kill Morty Jr., Morty intervened, going so far as to state that he'd risk his own life to save his son's. In the end, however, Morty Jr. became spiteful of his father, going so far as to title his autobiography "''My Horrible Father"''. Morty was shocked and hurt at this; Beth told him that a parent can only do the best they can, but only said dejectedly "I hope he's eating enough", showing that in spite of everything, he still loves and worries about his son.

===School===
====[[Jessica]]====
Jessica is Morty's main love interest in the series. She is a student who goes to school with him and is in a few of his classes. Morty rarely talks to Jessica and mainly just admires her from afar. On a few occasions, he's talked to her. In the [[Pilot]], he started to have a conversation with her, about Rick, before Rick pulled him away. In ''[[Ricksy Business]]'', Jessica was at his house for Summer's party and Morty had a conversation with her about her failing relationship with [[Brad]]. Later, Morty showed her around Rick's garage and introduced a bunch of his inventions to her. Currently, they can be considered friendly acquaintances.

The closest the two of them have ever come to dating, was in the episode ''[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]'', where Jessica and Morty were seen holding hands with each other at the school dance. Given that Jessica was in a relationship with Brad at the time, it's unlikely that they were dating, and they were simply together as friends. Also, given the expulsion of [[Tiny Rick]] in that episode, whatever relationship they previously had in that episode, is definitely over.

Being a teenager, Morty's love for Jessica extends beyond romance, as he has a lot of sexual fantasies about her. In the [[Pilot]] episode, Morty fell asleep in class and had a wet dream about fondling Jessica's boobs. In ''[[Mortynight Run]]'', it was revealed that Morty also has a foot fetish for her and occasionally has erotic thoughts about her feet.

====[[Mr. Goldenfold]]====
Mr. Goldenfold is Morty's math teacher, and because Morty is really bad at math, he has a lot of problems with him. Mr. Goldenfold constantly has to yell at Morty and get angry at him for his behavior in class, and Morty is too unmotivated to do anything about it.

In the [[Pilot]] episode, Morty fell asleep in Mr. Goldenfold's class, not paying attention to his teachings, and instead thinking about Jessica. While he was asleep, Morty's hands started to play with Mr. Goldenfold's man boobs. He stood there and yelled at him for it, but Morty didn't wake up. Due to him taking some weird pleasure from it, Mr. Goldenfold waited there and enjoyed it for a few minutes, before he officially "got mad". In the episode ''[[Lawnmower Dog]]'', instead of studying and doing his work, Morty got help from Rick, so that they could incept Mr. Goldenfold's dreams, and make him give Morty an undeserved "A" in his math class. In ''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]'', Morty once again fell asleep in Mr. Goldenfold's class. Just as he did, he spontaneously transformed into a car, which caused a huge distraction for Mr. Goldenfold.

==Trivia==

*Morty's voice, and general appearance stemmed from an early Justin Roiland short entitled ''[[The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti]]'', which was a parody of ''Back to the Future''. Morty parodies [[wikipedia:Marty McFly|Marty McFly]] from ''[[wikipedia:Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]''.
**Another character named Marty with an appearance and voice completely identical to Morty's also appears in Justin Roiland's short ''Paloni Pitch Presentation''. Another identical character named Pumpkinseeds and Peanuts, voiced by [[wikipedia:Andy Dick|Andy Dick]], appears in another short; ''The Unmarketables''.
*He was deemed the "one true Morty" by the imprisoned Mortys in "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]".
* Morty is considered by Rick to be the "Morty-est" Morty.
*Since he helped conceive [[Morty Jr.]] in "[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]", this makes him '''Morty Smith, Sr.'''
*Prior to and during the series, Morty has a crush on his classmate [[Jessica]]. He was also attracted to [[Annie]] in "[[Anatomy Park (episode)|Anatomy Park]]" and started a relationship with her. In "Look Who's Purging Now", Morty has a crush on [[Arthricia]].
*Morty masturbates frequently, and according to him, "everywhere". In "[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]", Morty mentioned that he watches a lot of porn on his laptop and masturbates in his bedroom. In "[[Total Rickall]]", a flashback showed Morty masturbating while standing up on the kitchen table, while thinking about a hot friend of his sister's. In "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]", while in an ultra-microscopic world, Morty mentioned that he masturbated to a curvy piece of driftwood.
*It was revealed in "[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]" that Rick modified Morty's DNA structure so he can transform into a car. However, Morty was unaware of this until Rick told him while they were chasing [[Zeep Xanflorp]].
*Morty has a foot fetish. As heard in [[Mortynight Run]], when Fart says "I communicate through what you call 'Jessica's feet', no, 'Telepathy'." "Jessica's feet" was an excerpt from Morty's mind.
*In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", Morty's legal age, under [[Galactic Federation]], became 35.
*Morty is agnostic.
*In "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]," it is said that Rick had at least one known assistant (named Kyle) prior to Morty.
*As seen in "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]" and said by [[Dan Harmon]], Morty is starting to get tired of Rick's behavior and is getting more frustrated with his insults.
* In a sense, as of Season 3, he's the only remaining member of the original cast. His versions of Summer, Beth and Jerry were left behind in the 'Cronenberged' timeline, and are possibly dead after being frozen by the Rick squad that found Morty and Summer in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", while Rick himself has lost his original body and has transferred his consciousness to another Rick.
*Up until the Season 5 finale, Morty was under the impression he was from Dimension C-137, stating "I'm Morty C-137" to the imprisoned Mortys in "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind", and to the Council of Ricks in "The Rickshank Rickdemption." As confirmed in "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", Rick C-137 never had his own Smith family, and thus Morty's dimension is not Dimension C-137 as Morty first believed. It is unknown what number Morty's dimension is designated, though it is known as the [[Cronenberged dimension|Cronenberged Dimension]].
