==Biography==
The original version of Morty's Girlfriend presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

Little is known about her, as her only appearance is during a montage in a single episode. She and Morty quickly started a relationship after the latter created a save point before making his move on her. Because the relationship went smoothly, Morty had no reason to return to his saved point and thus the two spent a lot of time together. At one point, the two of them were involved in a plane crash. Nobody knew where they were, leaving Morty to go out and seek help. After he succeeded in doing so, she was happy to be home with Morty, until Jerry found the save point remote and returned him to the point just before they met. Upon returning, Morty attempted to tell her the truth, which only frightened his now former girlfriend, who pepper sprayed him and ran away. During the scuffle, Morty accidentally fell onto the save point remote and created a new save point, thus ruining his chance at another shot with her.

During Morty's fake death, she briefly returned before watching him jump into the vat of fake acid. Thinking he was really dead, she ran away.

==Appearance==
She has dark brown hair, wears glasses, a black choker, a teal long sleeve fingerless t-shirt with dark teal parts and a light teal circle on it, a reddish-brown striped skirt and tan coloured flats. She also has an olive green shoulder bag too.
==Personality==
She appears to be caring and was quite happy with Morty.

==Trivia==
* She was the third official girlfriend of Morty.
* As she was in another dimension, she clearly has a counterpart in Mortyâ€™s home dimension.
* Despite pepper spraying him, she appears when Morty is about to jump in the vat of acid, hinting that after remembering everything he did, she was willing to forgive him before watching him die.
