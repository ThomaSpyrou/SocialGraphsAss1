The '''Mortytown Locos''' were three alternative versions of Morty that were a gang who operated in the [[Mortytown]] district of the [[The Citadel]]. They were all disintegrated by [[Cop Morty]], along with their hideout.

==History==
The Mortytown Locos were the local gang in Mortytown, robbing stores and producing bootleg fuel for [[Portal gun|portal guns]] with [[Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick]]. They robbed a [[Morty Mart]], which sent Cop Morty and [[Cop Rick]] after them. While watching [[President Morty]]'s speech on TV, the two cops tracked them down and arrested them. A fourth gang member hid in another room and played scared and confused when found by Cop Rick, before stabbing him in the shoulder when he let his guard down. Cop Morty ultimately set off a device which disintegrated the whole building with the Mortytown Locos inside.
