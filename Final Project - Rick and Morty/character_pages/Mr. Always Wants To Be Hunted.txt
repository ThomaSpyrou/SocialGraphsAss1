'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a character who appears in "[[Mortyplicity]]". 

==Biography==

==Appearance==
He is a short humanoid with yellow skin, a large, sweaty head and a plump body. 

He wears a target outfit with black lines on the arms and legs, and a red bullseye on the chest.

==Personality==
As his name suggests, Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted simply wants to be hunted, presumably by anyone in the vicinity. If he is not hunted or ignored, he'll either get upset or become homicidal and kill whoever failed to hunt them, remarking they should've done so.
