'''Mr. Booby Buyer''' is a character who appeared in the episode [[Meeseeks and Destroy]]. He is a perverted inter-dimensionalÂ being who apparently tries to buy boobs from people, using [[Schmeckle]]s.

==Biography==
Mr. Booby Buyer was at the [[Thirsty Step]] Tavern at the same time as [[Rick]] and [[Morty]]. While Rick was attempting to understand the value of Schmeckles, the waitress expressed how her fake breasts cost her 25 schmeckles. Immediately after Mr. Booby Buyer appeared and offer the waitress 25 schmeckles for her breasts, which she declined. Dissatisfied, he retreated behind a wooden girder.

==Appearance==
Mr. Booby Buyer is a bald green-scaled reptilian creature with two eyes, one nose and one mouth. His body is circular, giving a likeness  to a bug. His two skinny arms end in a hand each with five fingers. He has four legs equally thin as his arms and wears brown pants over them. A long thick scaled tail protrudes from the back of his pants.
