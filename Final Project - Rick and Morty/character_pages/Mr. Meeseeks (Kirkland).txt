Unlike the blue-skinned Mr. Meeseeks, the Kirkland Mr. Meeseeks has red skin, orange-gold body and facial hair, and dark circles under his eyes. He is also seen to have some little white hair strings on his body.

== Personality ==
Kirkland Meeseeks doesn't seem like he cares about fulfilling a request or helping others, unlike the blue Meeseeks.

When Rick pushed the button, the Kirkland Meeseeks says "What do you want?" while smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke in Rick's face. Wasp Rick, feeling bad for Rick, said "Damn, your Morty sucks."
