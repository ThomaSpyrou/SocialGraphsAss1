[[File:Mr._Poopybutthole's_Cat.png|260px|thumb]]'''Mr. Poopybutthole's Cat''' is the unnamed pet cat of [[Mr. Poopybutthole|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Poopybutthole]]. It first appeared in the post-credits epilogue of "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]".
==Biography==
During their move into their apartment, [[Mr. Poopybutthole|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Poopybutthole]] supposedly went to an animal shelter, indicated by the "Who Saved Who?" sticker, where they adopted a cat and a [[Mr. Poopybutthole's Dog|dog]]. The cat and dog got along, quite well. They stuffed themselves in stockings together and slept next to each other.

In the post-credits epilogue of "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]", the cat was seen in Mr. Poopybutthole's Apartment with him. While Mr. Poopybutthole raved about the season, he poured his cat some food. The cat ate the food, while Mr. Poopybutthole got food of his own, delivered to him by the pizza man.

In "[[The Poop in My Pants]]", the cat apparently got sick from unknown causes. It lost its ability to move and started getting some kind of pusÂ in its eyes. The cat would later pass away, much to the sadness of Mr. Poopybutthole and the dog, sadly who mourned over the loss.
