'''Mrs. Refrigerator''' was a false character, portrayed by the [[Alien Parasites]]. She appeared in the episode [[Total Rickall]].

==History==
She appeared as an anthropomorphic purple refrigerator who was passed off as [[Beth Smith|Beth's]] lifelong best friend.

She was accused of being fake by [[Rick Sanchez]]. Mrs. Refrigerator tried reminding him of the time she rode a roller coaster with the family, but everyone was quick to point out that that memory was good. Mrs. Refrigerator then admitted the jig was up and started freaking out and running for the door before she was blasted to death.
