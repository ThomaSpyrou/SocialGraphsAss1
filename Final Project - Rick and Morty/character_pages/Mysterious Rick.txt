- ''Such delicate skin! Could he be... the Legendary [[Morty]]?''

'''Mysterious Rick''' is the first Morty-battling Rick that appears in the Pocket Mortys game. When he opens a portal to the protagonist Rick's garage, Rick thinks that he wants his [[MortyPad]], but in reality he wants Rick's Morty. He challenges the protagonist Rick and loses, then flees back into his portal. Rick follows him by going through the open portal, starting the main quest line of [[Pocket Mortys]]. While In-game of [[Pocket Mortys]] you can challenge him on other dimensions before receiving the last Council Badge.

After protagonist Rick receives enough Rick Badges, Mysterious Rick returns to attack the Citadel of Ricks and capture the council members. All but [[Riq IV]] are captured. Your Rick challenges Mysterious Rick again, receiving Rick Riq's Badge with an M on it after winning. Riq IV calls two Guard Ricks who cuff Mysterious Rick. Before he leaves, Rick takes his cape and sash and becomes the most powerful Rick in the universe.
