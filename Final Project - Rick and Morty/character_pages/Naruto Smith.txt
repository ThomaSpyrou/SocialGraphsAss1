'''Naruto Smith''' is the gigantic biological offspring of [[Summer Smith]] and [[Morty Smith]], born from one of [[Rick Sanchez]]'s experiments that went wrong. He is nicknamed the "'''Giant Incest Baby'''", and later the "'''Giant Incest Monster'''".

==History==
He first appeared in "[[Rickdependence Spray]]", created when Morty's genetically-enhanced super-sized sperm "[[Sticky]]" entered Summer's enlarged ovum. He is currently in Space.

Later prior to [[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]] it was revealed that he was captured by the government and taken to a secret base on Mars where Summer was abducted by agents in order for her to help them make Naruto into a human weapon, but upon spending time with him, Summer bonded with her son and helped him escape. Later Summer, Along with Morty, Jerry and Beth rode on to Naruto in order to save Rick when the previous owners of the Gotron Ferrete attempted to reclaim their rides and kill Rick, only for Naruto to defeat them and save his Great-Grandfather.

==Appearance==
He is a gigantic, red-haired child (the same color as Summer), with one right eye bigger than the left. He has chin length hair and light skin. He wears a diaper colored to look like the United States flag and broken cuffs around his right wrist and left ankle after escaping a United States government facility.

==Appearances==
===[[Season 5]]===
* "[[Rickdependence Spray]]"
* "[[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]]"

==Trivia==
* In the episode "[[Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion]]", Summer names him Naruto after helping him escape from Mars.
* His name is a reference to Naruto Uzumaki, the main protagonist of ''[[w:c:naruto:Naruto|Naruto]]'' and ''[[w:c:naruto:Naruto: Shippuden|Naruto: Shippuden]]''.
* It is unknown how he is able to survive in space.
**This might be because of the processes that mutated Morty's sperm and/or enlarged Summer's egg.
* He is the second son of Morty after [[Morty Jr.|Morty Jr]]. whose fate remains unknown.
* Rick appears to like his new great grandson.
