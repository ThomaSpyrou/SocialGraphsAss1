The '''Nippalians'''<ref>[[Rick and Morty Character Guide]] page 77</ref> is a species of blue-skinned humanoid aliens inhabiting an [[Unity's Planet|unnamed planet]], which was taken over by the hivemind [[Unity]]. The species is split by two different standards of nipple appearance, causing a civil war.

==Trivia==
*According to ''[[The Art of Rick and Morty]]'', most of these aliens were already background characters in the show, only changed by giving them blue skin and three bulbs.
