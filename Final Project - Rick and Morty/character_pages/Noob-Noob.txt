{{Quote|God Damn!|Noob Noob's Catchphrase}}
'''Noob-Noob''' is a small masked character who made his first appearance in ''[[Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender]]''. He is the underappreciated intern of [[the Vindicators]], and most of his tasks are janitor work. 

Noob-Noob appears to be ready to graduate to a full Vindicator, but is forced to remain behind after [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] gets drunk, passes out, and defecates all over the ship's holo-table. Nevertheless, he seems to be the only member of the Vindicators that enjoys Rick's humor, and as Rick later reveals to [[Morty Smith|Morty]] (while drunk), Noob-Noob is the only one that Rick values, even more than Morty, to which Morty replies with "Motherf***er." At the end of the episode, [[Logic]] raps about how underappreciated Noob-Noob is, although Rick doesn't remember him.
