'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an alien diplomat that appeared in the episode [[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]. 

==Biography==
The {{PAGENAME}} has at some point in his life dwelt among Humans on the planet [[Earth]]. This led him to conclude that human culture is built around their penises.

In his later years, he was at [[St. Gloopy Noops Hospital]] at the same time as [[Jerry Smith]], most likely following [[Shrimply Pibbles]] when he was transported there shortly after Jerry. When Jerry was asked to donate his penis to save Pibbles' life, the {{PAGENAME}} told of his experience from the Human world and how important their penis is to them. Jerry, insulted by his simple view on humanity, announced that he would donate his penis after all.

==Appearance==
The Old Reptile is a very elderly alien who was in a wheelchair.  His face is wrinkled with the skin on the face being yellow and orange colored while his chin had tentacle like appendages that were shaded blue on the tips.  He has many brown colored spikes on his head.  He wears a red robe with some tan on the middle.  His hands consists of two fingers while his feet have three toes.

==Trivia==

* The actual name of the Old Reptile is unknown, however Herzog is credited as voicing Shrimply Pibbles.
* His robe, combined with the fact that he appeared when the doctors and alien diplomats were talking to Jerry about donating his private parts to save [[Shrimply Pibbles]], caused many viewers to mistake the Old Reptile for Pibbles himself.
