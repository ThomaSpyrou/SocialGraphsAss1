He appears in the [[Pickle Rick (Episode)|episode]] of the same name and makes a cameo appearance in [[Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat]] in a death crystal vision.

==Appearance==
In this form, Rick's only functional body parts are his brain, ears, eyes and a mouth. In all other regards, he became an ordinary pickle. He is vulnerable to dehydration and can be damaged (although replacing a lost portion with an ordinary pickle just left a scar when reverting back to human form).

Changing back to human is only possible with the help of an Anti-Pickle Serum.

Two augmentations were shown in the episode [[Pickle Rick (Episode)|Pickle Rick]]
*Pickle Rick with Cockroach Limbs - Rick is first seen wrapped up in cockroach limbs that twitch when Rick presses a part of their brain with his tongue.
*Pickle Rick in Rat Suit - Constructed of rat limbs and brain, this form of Pickle Rick is very nimble and demonstrative of a level of athleticism not often seen from Rick.
