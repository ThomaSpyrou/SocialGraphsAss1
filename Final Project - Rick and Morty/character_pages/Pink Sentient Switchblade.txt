The '''Pink Sentient Switchblade '''is a pink sentient switchblade created by [[Rick Sanchez]] for his daughter [[Beth Smith|Beth]] when she was a little girl. Beth had requested the switchblade along with a number of other horrific items.

Beth later uses the switchblade to murder several Froopians when trying to bring [[Tommy]] back from [[Froopyland]]. Both she and the switchblade seemed to enjoy the experience.
