The '''Pom Poms'''<ref>[[The Art of Rick and Morty Vol 2]] page 82</ref> are an alien species appearing in the Rick and Morty Universe. They made their only appearance in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]".

==History==
They were in a war with an unnamed alien species but lost that war and were enslaved after [[Rick Sanchez]] gave their enemies advanced weaponry to win the war with. As a result, these aliens were forced to serve as the staff in the [[Immortality Field Resort]], but they would never forget the war or Rick Sanchez for aiding their enemy. 

==Appearance==
The Pom Poms are aliens who have a simian appearance. They have two eyes, a mouth with a fang slightly protruding from the lower jaw and two appendages on their heads that look like bonsai trees. A lot of their body is covered in light blue fur and they have a tail that has a small white puff ball at the end. They are bipedal. Their blood color is pink.

==Trivia==
* Their design was based on an '80s plushie vibe, like that of the ''Care Bears''.
* Their original name on storyboard was "Native Alien Race".
* Though their official name is not "Pom Poms", it is what they were called by the series' artists during production.
