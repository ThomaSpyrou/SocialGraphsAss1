'''Poncho''' was a character in ''[[Rick and Morty]]''. He appears as a bodyguard and the main antagonist in the episode "[[Anatomy Park (Episode)|Anatomy Park]]." Poncho was a hired gun for [[Dr. Xenon Bloom]] to provide security for [[Anatomy Park (Location)|Anatomy Park]].

He originally approaches [[Morty]] with disdain, but later compliments the boy's ability to think on his feet. It is later revealed that Poncho was responsible for the outbreak of [[diseases]], when Morty discovers Poncho carrying around the [[Bubonic Plague]].

Poncho reveals that he'd perform any job over working for Dr. Xenon Bloom, who gave him horrible employee benefits. When the safety of [[Annie]] is threatened, Morty throws himself at Poncho. The Bubonic plague then turns on Poncho, who falls from a high balcony.

==Trivia==
*The tattoo on Poncho's right shoulder is an ode to the South African band ''[[Wikipedia:Die Antwoord|Die Antwoord]]''.
*He could be a nod to Jurassic Park character Dennis, they both were workers to the park who betrayed the CEO for monetary gain and subsequently died to the dinosaurs/diseases.
