}}'''Poop Jesus''' is an alien messiah, from an alien religion that [[Tony]] believes in. He is essentially an alien version of [[Jesus Christ]], who is obsessed with pooping in the toilet. He only appeared as a holographic simulation in Tony's mind, so it's unknown whether or not he actually exists.
