}}'''Priest Witherspoon''' is a priest, who fell victim to the [[Lovefinderrz]] app and went out with [[Josiah]] on impulse.

== Biography ==
The original Priest Witherspoon presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

Priest Witherspoon was set to marry [[Jeff]] and [[Maggie]], who met each other through Lovefinderrz. While performing the ceremony, [[Summer Smith]] came crashing through one of the church windows in a parachute and disrupted the event. Summer told Jeff she could explain everything, which he said was unnecessary and asked Priest Witherspoon to marry him to Summer, instead of Maggie. Before Witherspoon could do this, however, Jeff ran off with a [[Richard|man on a motorcycle]]. Seconds later, a [[Josiah|construction worker]] broke through the church wall on a lift and showed his match with the priest. Witherspoon quickly joined him on the lift and the two exited the church.

== Trivia ==
*His name is a pun on the famous celebrity, Reese Witherspoon.
*Despite being a priest (which requires one to take a vow of celibacy), he still downloaded a dating app.
