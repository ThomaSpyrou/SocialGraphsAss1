{{Quote|Oh, this is going to be such a mindf**k!|Prince Nebulon|M. Night Shaym-Aliens!}}
'''Prince Nebulon''' was the leader of the [[Zigerions]] in ''[[Rick and Morty]]''. He appears as the main antagonist in ''[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]''. He has a long-standing grudge against [[Rick Sanchez]] and is committed to stealing the recipe for [[Concentrated Dark Matter]] from him. He is apparently concerned with the discoloration of his butthole flaps.

== History ==
After seeking the recipe for dark matter, Nebulon created a plan to abduct [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and place him into a simulated reality in order to trick him into giving up the formula. He employs [[Kevin]] to research human nudity in order to simulate a convincing "[[Morty]]" to help bring Rick's guard down. While he successfully had Rick kidnapped, he also inadvertently has [[Jerry Smith (C-137)|Jerry Smith]] kidnapped as well which forced him to divert a low amount of the simulation toward Jerry’s. After putting Rick and Jerry in a simulation, he had them put in several layers of more simulations, in hopes of tricking Rick into revealing the formula. Soon after waking up, Rick quickly realized that he was in a simulation while Jerry remained completely oblivious. This caused Rick to try to escape with Jerry and "Morty" which caused them to escape the first layer of simulation and go into the second layer, in which they distract the guards before boarding a shuttle. As the duo arrives home, Rick enters the code for his safe only for the second simulation to be revealed. As Nebulon reveals this to them and states how they now know the code for Rick's safe, Rick has "Morty" flash them before grabbing Jerry and escaping in one of the Zigerion ships in the hanger. As they escape the ship and are being chased by the Zigerions, Rick tells "Morty" the formula for the dark matter to outrun the them. Nebulon however stops the third layer of simulation and reveals the whole scheme to Rick, before having Rick and Jerry be jettisoned into space in an actual shuttle. 

== Death ==
After jettisoning the duo, Nebulon celebrates the achievement and tries to form dark matter with the given ingredients. However unbeknownst to the entire crew, the recipe was actually a bomb as Rick actually knew of the scheme from the very beginning. After pouring all of the ingredients together, the bomb explodes, killing Nebulon and his entire crew as Jerry observes while in safety in the shuttle.

== Trivia ==
*Prince Nebulon and the ''[[wikipedia:Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' character [[wikipedia:Tobias Fünke|Tobias Fünke]], also played by David Cross, both share an aversion to nudity. In ''Arrested Development'' Tobias has a condition called "never-nude syndrome" where he wears cut-off jean shorts underneath his clothes so that no one, not even himself or his wife, can see him nude.
*Along with Jerry's voice actor [[Chris Parnell]], David Cross is the second voice actor featured in ''Rick and Morty'' to have appeared in ''[[wikipedia:Archer (TV series)|Archer]]. ''Parnell voices comptroller ''Cyril Figgis'', and Cross voices anthropologist ''Noah''.
