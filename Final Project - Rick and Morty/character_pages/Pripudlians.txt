The '''Pripudlians''' are a pink, worm-like alien race that exist in the world of Rick and Morty. They appear in a lot of intergalactic places, but do not seem to make much commotion about themselves, or travel in groups. Like most other aliens, Pripudlians do not wear pants.

==Physiology==
Pripudlians move by using a combination of the end of their tail to push themselves forward and slither like snakes/worms. They always appear upright and never lying on the ground, meaning that though they look like worms they do not behave similar to worms. Their arms a typically short and skinny, implyng weak arm-strength and generally non-aggressive behavior.

==Culture==
According to [[Rick]], Pripudlians are some of the greatest gamers in the multiverse. They also had their own version of ''GamerGate'', but it was appearantly "even worse than ours".<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/5SXVejCwY0/ Blips and Chitz - Rickstaverse]</ref>
