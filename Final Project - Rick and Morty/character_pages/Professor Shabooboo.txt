{{Character|image=shabooboo.png|species=Human|age=Unknown, possibly 30s|status=Deceased|job=Sperm Expert|home planet=Earth|only=Rickdependence Spray}}The original Professor Shabooboo presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

Professor Shabooboo is the leading expert in sperm and helps [[the President]] solve the monster sperm crisis. He steals [[Summer Smith|Summer's]] idea of enlarging one of her eggs to attract the sperm to Las Vegas. However, upon realizing that the monster sperm are actually [[Morty Smith|Morty's]] enlarged sperm, he decides to launch the egg into space but states that it takes 30 minutes to launch the egg into space. He then says that there is one solution, but jumps off the tower saying "See you all in hell!" before hitting the ground and dying.
