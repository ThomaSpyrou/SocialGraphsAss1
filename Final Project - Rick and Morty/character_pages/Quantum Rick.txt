'''Quantum Rick''' was one of the six members of the defunct [[Council of Ricks]] and possibly its only surviving member.

==History==
This Rick was a member of the Council of Ricks, who at one point tried to sentence Rick C-137 after he was framed for murder. Rick C-137 would later take revenge on the entire council, including Quantum Rick, who was either murdered by Rick or managed to escape whilst Rick C-137 assumed his identity. Because of this uncertainty, Quantum Rick's status is unknown.

==Appearance==
Quantum Rick shared the general appearance of the titular [[Rick Sanchez]] but sported a puffier hairstyle.

==Personality==

Quantum Rick is the second council member that the player battles. To challenge him, the player must beat four Ricks in other dimensions and earn four more badges.

==Trivia==
[[File:RickWithQuantumRicksBody.png|thumb|left|[[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] in [[Commander in Chief Rick]]'s body disguised as Quantum Rick.]]
*Because the [[Series 9000 Brainalyzer]] had been in the ship that [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] (in [[Commander in Chief Rick]]'s body) ordered to be destroyed, it could not have been used to switch bodies with Quantum Rick.
**This implies that Rick C-137 either murdered Quantum Rick and stole his clothing or Quantum Rick left the clothing behind to not seem like a high target when escaping.
**Rick C-137 wore a black bodysuit and had places for weapon storage under Quantum Rick's robe, while nearly the entire council carried no weapons and wore brown pants, meaning that Rick C-137 took Quantum Rick's robe, gloves, and boots, only, and altered his hairstyle.
