The '''Real Fake Doors Salesman''' is a character who appeared in "[[Rixty Minutes]]". He is an interdimensional being who sells fake doors at a company that is all about doors that would not open or lead to anywhere. The commercial then goes to him leaving the studio, getting stuck in traffic, and driving home. He makes a sandwich and reveals that the real fake doors commercial is still going on as he moves to the same room he started at. He then says to call and order real fake doors, then begins spouting out stuff about slogans and nonsense that extended the commercial farther than it was supposed to. It appears that he comes from a world where commercials go on forever.
