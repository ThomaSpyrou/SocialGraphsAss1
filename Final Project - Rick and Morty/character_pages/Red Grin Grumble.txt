{{Character|name = Red Grin Grumble|species = unknown|age = unknown|first mention = A Rickle in Time}}Red Grin Grumble is a supposedly non-existent character referred to by [[Rick Sanchez]] in "[[A Rickle in Time]]", the [[Season 2]] opening episode.
Rick had thrown a massive party while Jerry and Beth were gone at the end of Season 1 resulting in the the utter destruction of the Smith home. In order to save their asses, Rick freezes time right as Jerry and Beth are walking up to the home.
After 6 months of frozen time, Rick, Morty, and Summer had finished fixing the home and were ready to re-start time. Morty - after vacuuming off his parents - replaced Jerry's shirt backwards right before Rick started time back up.
After the initial "welcome home", Beth asks Jerry if his shirt is on backwards. [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] then claims to know he's wearing his shirt backwards, "Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid!".
As Jerry walks out of earshot, Rick equates him to someone named 'Red Grin Grumble', saying, "Man, that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on." [[Morty Smith|Morty]] and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] immediately laugh at the reference afterwhich Rick reveals that he made Red Grin Grumble up entirely, and castigates them for laughing at a joke they never could have understood.
There is, however, further speculation that Red Grin Grumble is in reference to somebody Rick actually knows or knows of, though we've not met him yet in the series. Rick, first saying it to himself as vocalized self-talk, hears Morty and Summer laughing - immediately knowing that they have no idea who RGG really is - mocks them for pretending to know and drives the undeniable point home by claiming Red Grin Grumble was made up on the spot.
