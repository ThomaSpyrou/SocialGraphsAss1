Reggie is a godlike being who is the former lover of [[Gaia]]. He appeared shortly after the Smith family visited her, revealing himself to be the true biological father of her children. 

After he grants power to [[Jerry]] and the unproductives, [[Rick]] flies up into the clouds and battles Reggie in his true form. After an intense struggle, Reggie is able to gain the upper hand and traps Rick with his fingers, but [[Summer]] and [[Morty]] fly a spacecraft into the back of his head, killing him instantly.
