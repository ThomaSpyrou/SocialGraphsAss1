===Dialogue===
====Pre-battle====
*"So, you found your way back here without getting killed?"
*"I guess you've earned my attention. Let's battle!"

====Post-battle====
*"Beginner's luck, Rick! Don't get too cocky."
*"Wait, you thought that's all you needed to do to get your portal gun back?<br />It's not going to be that easy, Rick. I don't even have it."
*"Come back when you have 6 badges and maybe you'll be closer."
