{{Quote|Hi Rick. Bye Rick.|D-99 to C-137's old body|The Rickshank Rickdemption}}
'''Rick D-99 '''was a member of [[SEAL Team Ricks]] who was sent by the [[Citadel of Ricks]] to assassinate [[Rick Sanchez (C-137)]]. He was clearly among the toughest and most dangerous Ricks as he was part of their elite assassination unit. His body was used by Rick C-137 in his elaborate plot to destroy the [[Galactic Federation]]. He was blown up when C-137 took control of a higher-class Rick and ordered another Rick to blow him up.

==Appearance==
Like the other members of SEAL Team Ricks, D-99 had a black line painted under each eye and wears a brown, robotic suit. Also like the other members, he had a very distinct hair style from regular Ricks by sporting a mohawk, but still had the same hair colour.

==Biography==
Rick was serving as a part of SEAL Team Ricks when the Citadel of Ricks found [[Morty]] and [[Summer Smith]] in [[Dimension C-137]] after having detected a compromised [[Portal gun]], and dispatched SEAL Team Ricks to infiltrate the Galactic Federal Prison and assassinate Rick (C-137) to avoid their secrets being leaked.

SEAL Team Ricks stormed the prison interrogation room right after Rick (C-137) managed to transfer his mind into [[Cornvelious Daniel]] and was about to leave. The SEALs gun down all the [[Gromflomites]] in the room (except Rick) before D-99 personally shoots Rick (C-137)'s body through the head, killing Cornvelious Daniel instead. Once Rick D-99 looks away, however, Rick (C-137) (in Convelious Daniel's body) is able to direct the [[Series 9000 Brainalyzer|Brainalyzer]] at D-99 and swap their minds just before another of the SEAL Ricks shoots Convelious Daniel's body, killing D-99. What follows is C-137 in D-99's body taking out the whole SEAL Team before escaping.

Later, Rick returns to the Citadel in a SEAL Team spaceship. Not willing to talk to anyone there except for someone with high clearance, [[Commander in Chief Rick]] scornfully opens the communication channel. Rick swiftly swaps their minds over the comm link using the prison's networked, commandeered<span style="font-weight:400;"> </span>[[Series 9000 Brainalyzer|Brainalyzer]]. Now in the Citadel, Rick orders a militia-worker at the Citadel to blow up the spaceship he was in, destroying the last remains of D-99.
