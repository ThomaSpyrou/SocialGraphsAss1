He and his grandson [[Morty Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Morty]] were the victims of [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty]].
==Biography==
In the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], Rick and his family were sitting around the table, eating breakfast. His daughter [[Beth Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Beth]] was telling to him that it was the one year anniversary of Rick returning to the house, after being gone from her life for so long. She suggested that she makes flying saucer shaped pancakes to celebrate, but he declined to it. Just then, [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty]] opened a portal, walked into the room, and shot Rick, as well as tranquilizing his grandson Morty and taking the boy with them.
==Appearance==
Rick was a tall, lanky old man. He had long legs and arms and is very skinny. He had a dimly tanned ashy complexion and light blue hair with a bald spot on the back of his head. He had spiky hair on his head and a unibrow. His face is wrinkly as he had bags under his eyelids and a pressure fold above his unibrow that follows its position and laugh lines on both sides of his mouth. He wears a white lab coat with a light blue green shirt underneath. He also wears brown pants, a dark brown belt with a yellow buckle, and black shoes. He is occasionally seen with some green spill from drinking or splattered vomit on his mouth which is the result of him from the massive amounts of alcohol he consumes on a daily basis, although this isn't always on his face but shows up mainly when he is drunk or after he throws up. Rick speaks in a rambling manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, again this is due to his drug and alcohol addiction.
==Personality==
Rick was a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. Rick is easily bored and does not do well with routine.
