==Appearance==
Rick Sanchez J-22 shares the general appearance of Rick Sanchez, but his bald spot extends all the way to his forehead and he wears a factory uniform and hairnet while working on the assembly line.

== Personality ==
Rick Sanchez J-22 lived a very boring life as a factory worker, hoping for a promotion to a better position. Deep down, he always had an inner frustration working as a simple factory worker, even though he was just as smart as all of the higher-up Ricks and has a knowledge of everything in the universe, and by becoming part of a society like this, even though it was made up entirely of [[Rick (disambiguation)|Ricks]] and [[Morty (disambiguation)|Mortys]], it took away everything that made Rick unique in their respective universes and in general. Eventually, he gets fed up with living in such a pathetic and low-paying job and goes on a rampage, killing his boss and locking himself in the flavor core with [[Simple Rick]], and subsequently demanding a portal gun to escape from his "prison," He is also not gullible, knowing that the portal gun given to him was likely pre-set to the [[Blender Dimension|blender dimension]]; however, he was consequently tricked by [[Rick D. Sanchez III]] into believing he was being promoted for his rebellious and anarchical attitude so the memory formed could be used as a new flavor for the wafer cookies.

== History ==
At one point, he became a member of the Citadel of Ricks and spent 15 years as a factory worker. He hoped to get a promotion, and when Regional Manager Rick promoted [[Cool Rick]] instead, who had only recently joined the citadel, he became even more bitter and disillusioned. This bitterness got to the point that he went on a rampage, destroying his wafer assembly machine and killing [[Regional Manager Rick]] in a fit of rage. After sealing himself into the flavor core, he took an unconscious [[Simple Rick]] as a hostage, and made demands to SWAT Team Ricks for an unregistered portal gun. His demands were met and he freed [[Simple Rick]] who was understandably disoriented, convincing him that he is going to be ok. This is followed by J-22 abruptly sending him through a portal, which had been underhandedly locked to the coordinates of the Blender Dimension by the SWAT Team. This tragically resulted in Simple Rick's brutal death at the hands of his captors.

Just before he is about to be apprehended, [[Rick D. Sanchez III]] appears just in the nick of time, commending J-22 for the guts he had to rebel against the bureaucratic system, saying he spent enough time as a factory worker, and then frees him from police custody. As he was being applauded by his coworkers and getting emotional over seeing a limo just for him, Rick D. Sanchez III subdued and rapidly used him as a replacement of Simple Rick's memory for the flavor of Simple Rick's Wafers.

It's unknown if he was present and died during the destruction of the Citadel or left it and survived his likely demise.
