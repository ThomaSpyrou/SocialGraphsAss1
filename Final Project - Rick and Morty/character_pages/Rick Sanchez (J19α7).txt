'''Rick Sanchez, '''commonly referred to as '''Doofus Rick, '''of [[Dimension J19α7]], is a very little respected Rick. He never had any children of his own, and so was assigned a Morty from a reality where everyone looked like Eric Stoltz from the movie "Mask". He has a secret friendship with [[Jerry Smith (C-132)]] where once a month they have a '''Jerry and Rick's Day of Fun''' to spend time together.

==Personality==
Rick is a kind and gentle Rick who genuinely cares for [[Jerry Smith (C-132)|Jerry]], and considers him his best friend. He sees Jerry as the son he never had, and wants to spend more time with him, but doesn't want to steal [[Jerry Smith (C-132)|Jerry]] away from his family. He is easily impressed with various things that [[Jerry Smith (C-132)|Jerry]] does, like printing t-shirts with their faces on them.

Rick enjoys rollercoasters, the zoo, flying with jetpacks, playing ball, taking goofy pictures, and drinking alcohol (particularly with [[Jerry Smith (C-132)|Jerry]]). He appears to be less intellegent than all of the other Ricks, but he has recently discovered a cure to cancer in his own dimension.

==Trivia==
* Because of how similar [[Dimension C-132]] is to [[Dimension C-137]], Rick (J19α7) is an exact replica of [[Doofus Rick|Rick Sanchez (J19ζ7)]] to mirror Jerry's friendship with a Doofus Rick.
* Like [[Doofus Rick]], this Rick never had any children of his own.
* Like [[Doofus Rick]], this Rick also has an Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.
