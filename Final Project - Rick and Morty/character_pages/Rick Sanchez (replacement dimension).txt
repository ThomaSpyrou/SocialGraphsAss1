}}{{Quote|Aw, c'mon, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great, that's the real reason.|font-size = 50|Rick|Rick Potion #9}}'''Rick Sanchez (C-131)''' was the alternative version of the original [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] who resided in the [[Replacement Dimension]] from the episode [[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]. He was the father of the current [[Beth Smith]], the father-in-law of the current [[Jerry Smith]], and the maternal grandfather of the current [[Summer Smith]] and this dimension's original [[Morty Smith (replacement dimension)|Morty Smith]].

==Biography==
The entire history of this Rick is exactly the same history as the [[Rick Sanchez|original Rick Sanchez]]. Including all five episodes of the series that took place before the events of the episode [[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]] except for one tiny but vital thing. In the same episode, after Rick transformed everyone on the planet into [[Cronenbergs]], he had enough care and energy to make an antidote and turn everyone back to normal again. He returned home the next day with his grandson Morty and they continued to work on his Ionic Defibrillator. However, this Defibrillator was programmed wrong and when he finished it, the entire thing exploded on him and killed them both. Just then, the Rick and Morty from [[Dimension C-137]] came in and they buried the bodies of their alternate dimension versions in the backyard and lived out the rest of their lives in their places.

In the episode [[Rixty Minutes]], Morty (C-137) showed to his adoptive sister [[Summer Smith|Summer]] the graves where they buried their versions, explaining to her the events of the previous episode and their deaths.

In the episode [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], Morty reminded Summer of her real grandfather Rick. Out of desperation to rescue Rick (C-137), she dug up his body to recover his portal gun, which hadn't been damaged in the explosion.
==Appearance==
Rick was a tall, lanky old man. He had long legs and arms and is very skinny. He had a dimly tanned ashy complexion and light blue hair with a bald spot on the back of his head. He had spiky hair on his head and a unibrow. His face was wrinkly as he has bags under his eyelids and a pressure fold above his unibrow that follows its position and laugh lines on both sides of his mouth. He wears a white lab coat with a light blue green shirt underneath. He also wears brown pants, a dark brown belt with a yellow buckle, and black shoes. He is occasionally seen with some green spill from drinking or splattered vomit on his mouth which is the result of him ODing from the massive amounts of alcohol he consumes on a daily basis, although this isn't always on his face but shows up mainly when he is drunk or after he throws up. Rick speaks in a rambling manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, again this is due to his drug and alcohol addiction.
==Personality==
Rick was a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. Rick is easily bored and does not do well with routine.

Unlike the original Rick though, this Rick seems to be a tiny bit more caring and a little bit less lazy. Although he is more helpful by him just by a tiny extent, this still had a huge butterfly effect, causing him to heroically save the world from Cronenbergs with his antidote. After the events of this, Rick was a much happier and nicer guy who got along with Morty better and had a lot more fun with him and their presence together was a lot more nice and tolerable (up until their premature demise).

== Trivia ==
* The Rickshank Redemption suggests that he, unlike C-137, was a member of [[The Citadel|The Citadel of Ricks]] given how their militia arrives after Rick's portal gun was used by Morty and Summer.
