{{Quote|Wubba lubba dub-dub!|Rick's Season 1 catchphrase|Season 1}}
'''Richard "Rick"''' '''Sanchez''', also known as '''Rick (C-137),''' is one of the titular two main protagonists (alongside [[Morty Smith]]) of ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]].''  

He is a megagenius<ref>"This is the megagenius equivalent to dying on the toilet" [[Pickle Rick (episode)|-Pickle Rick (episode)]]</ref> scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his "[[Beth Smith|daug]][[Space Beth|hter's]]" [[Smith Family|family]], as well as the safety of their son, [[Morty]]. Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. As time has gone on, more has been revealed about his character, his backstory explaining much of his behaviour. At the same time, Rick has continuously committed more heinous acts<ref>[[Morty's Mind Blowers]]</ref><ref>[[The Vat of Acid Episode]]</ref>, certifying him as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.     

He is voiced by [[Justin Roiland]].     

==Biography==
[[File:Pubescent Rick.png|left|thumb|A twelve year old Rick, successfully rewiring a television.]]
While Rick's backstory remained shrouded in mystery for much of the series, it's clear that he always had a knack for science and invention, being able to rewire and fix a television around the age of 12. It wasn't until "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" where Rick's past is finally shown in great detail. The "totally fabricated" backstory shown in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]" was mostly based on the truth and further hinted at in "[[Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort]]". Prior to the beginning of the series, Rick had a fairly normal middle-class childhood and had developed an interest in tinkering with things at a young age. As an adult, he married a woman named [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]] and they had a daughter, [[Beth Sanchez (C-137)|Beth]]. Rick eventually became a scientist who was struggling to invent [[Portal Technology|teleportation]]. One day, he was visited by an [[Weird Rick|alternate version of himself]], who offered him the ability to travel to different realities, but Rick refused. Angered by this, the other Rick sent a bomb through a portal, possibly attempting to kill Rick C-137, but instead killed Diane and Beth. Rick grieved for an unknown period of time, before inventing his own [[Portal Gun|portal gun]] and going on a quest for revenge. 

Rick would spend the next few decades searching for the Rick who murdered his family. He eventually became a weapons dealer, trying to find parts for a device to help him track down the one who killed his family. Rick eventually met [[Birdperson]] at a [[Burningmanapaloozaflargabarg|festival]]<ref>[[Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort]]</ref>, and formed rock band called "[[The Flesh Curtains]]" together with [[Squanchy]].<ref>[[Get Schwifty]]</ref> The three eventually formed the core of the resistance against the [[Galactic Federation]], culminating in the Battle of Blood Ridge. After winning the battle, Rick offered Birdperson the chance to join him in his adventures throughout the multiverse, but when Birdperson refused. Hurt by this, Rick left to continue his quest for revenge, hoping to eventually find someone more agreeable to join him on his adventures. 

During this time, Rick murdered several of his alternate selves, all of which belonged to an unknown organization of Ricks, yet none of them were the one Rick he was searching for. At this point, Rick had become depressed after failing to find his family's murderer and often used alcohol to numb his constant mental anguish. Eventually, the other Ricks banded together to try and stop the so-called "Rickest Rick". However, even this proved to be futile and Rick, yet again, murdered most of the alliance set on taking him down. Because of his unstoppable nature, the other Ricks eventually admitted defeat to Rick C-137, acknowledging him as their leader. This would lead to the construction of [[The Citadel|the Citadel of Ricks]] as part of their truce. Rick himself oversaw the construction process, but he soon left after it was built due to how the other Ricks wanted to run it, leaving it to be run by the Council of Ricks. Shortly after, Rick crashed into the house of [[Beth Smith (Cronenberged dimension)|Beth Smith]], a version of his daughter who never died, who believed this Rick to be her original absent father, and inserted himself into the family. This, of course, lead to the start of the series, where Rick has supposedly returned from his 20 year long absence.<ref>[[Rickmurai Jack]]</ref>

As of now, Rick is about 70 years old and currently resides in his room in the Smith house. He also uses the garage as partial living quarters. In the garage, he works on his inventions and science - for example, traveling to other dimensions, building various robots and devices, and causing general mayhem in different parts of the universe, be it dimensions, planets, or alternate realities. A notable aspect of Rick's development is that as the series has progressed, Rick's god-like status has been moved to the forefront of the story. Many characters refer to him as the smartest man in the universe<ref>[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]</ref>, whilst he himself has called himself a god and demonstrated his unstoppable nature.<ref>[[The Rickchurian Mortydate]]</ref> 

==Appearance==
Rick is a tall, old hispanic-american man. He has long legs and arms, and is very skinny. He has a dimly tanned ashy complexion and grey-blue hair with a bald spot on the back of his head. He has spiky blue hair on his head and a unibrow. His face is wrinkly as he has bags under his eyelids and a pressure fold above his unibrow that follows its position and laugh lines on both sides of his mouth. He wears a white lab coat with a turquoise undershirt underneath it. He also wears brown pants, a dark brown belt with a yellow buckle, and black shoes. He is occasionally seen with some green spill on his mouth, showing up mainly when he is drunk, or during a rare chance where he throws up. Rick speaks in a rambling, stammering manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, usually from being drunk or high. Interestingly, while he remains identical throughout the series, Rick has occupied the body of one of his alternate selves, having taken over his mind during the Season 3 premiere. Since then, this body has been destroyed and he now inhabits a clone of this Rick’s body.

Rick also sports a range of cybernetic enhancements, which he occasionally uses during perilous situations. From these moments, it can be reasonably assumed that both of his arms and at least one of his eyes are now completely cybernetic.

==Personality==
Rick is a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, cloning technology, cybernetic implants, various energy weapons and force fields, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. Rick is easily bored and does not do well with routine. When his [[Curse Purge Plus!|curse removing store]] in the episode [[Something Ricked This Way Comes|"Something Ricked This Way Comes"]] started requiring real work, Rick simply lit the whole store on fire and abandoned it. He regularly goes to other dimensions to harvest resources and will often willingly kill aliens to get them. He is willing to be extremely brutal such as when people betray him or his life or those close to him are in danger. He is usually portrayed as homicidal and having a large disregard for life, enough that he came close to bombing the world with neutrinos while drunk. He was shown to find killing fun during the Purge and was even willing to kill Morty's half-Gazorpian son due to the child's danger to everyone and unstable nature.[[File:Rick.png|thumb|100px]]This does not make him completely heartless, however, as he has been shown to be shocked, startled or annoyed by the loss of life that he deems unnecessary, foolish, or unreasonable. He was annoyed at Morty for letting [[Fart]] live, resulting in a chase with local police that cost many bystanders their lives. In addition to that, he was panicked when [[Unity]] destroyed an entire city that Rick thought still had people in it since he was unsure if Summer and Morty were there or not. He also was shocked and upset by people he was close to dying or nearly dying, such as when [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] was shot and he ran to his side in fear for the latter's life. When [[Bird Person]] was killed by [[Tammy Gueterman|Tammy]], Rick flies into a rage, mowing down multiple Federation troops. In "[[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]", Rick gasps when seeing Jerry being shot several times, and left mutilated. During the time of the Festival, he only watched the killing for a few short seconds before becoming overwhelmed by the violence and vomiting. Later, when helping [[Arthricia]] get revenge against the upper class, he felt he had done enough killing and began to find it gratuitous. In the past, Rick was a "hero" like [[Space Beth]] but eventually stopped, deeming it a “phase”.

Contrary to popular belief, Rick is not a nihilist. Although his commonly-stated viewpoint on life may be the typical nihilistic idealism that "nothing has meaning", he doesn't always put his money where his mouth is. Rick expresses love and emotion for his family and lovers on an almost episodic basis. Plot relevant instances include "[[The ABC's of Beth]]", which proves his fatherly love for Beth and "[[Auto Erotic Assimilation]]", where he's being dumped by Unity made him depressed enough to cry. Rick frequently reminds people that he's above everything that could hold meaning or value to him and made "I don't give a fuck!" his new catchphrase in "[[Ricksy Business]]", but this is all a mask. Rick is shown to care about maintaining relationships with others and holds a sentimental value of his family.

Rick has the tendency to be possessive and dominating of Morty, believing the boy to be his own personal helper. This doesn't prevent Rick from genuinely caring about Morty. He occasionally uses his own inventions to improve his grandson's life, such as invading the dreams of [[Mr. Goldenfold]] to help raise his math grades, though this could have been a tactic for Morty to skip more school to go on adventures with Rick <ref name="Lawnmower Dog">''[[Lawnmower Dog]]''</ref>. Rick also demonstrates being fairly protective of Morty, as shown in the episode "''[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]"'', where he eventually sets aside his cynicism to allow Morty to have a positive adventure, and abruptly kills [[Mr. Jellybean]] as the two are leaving the fantasy world because of the previous attempted rape on Morty.<ref name="Meeseeks and Destroy">''[[Meeseeks and Destroy|Meeseeks and Destroy]]''</ref> He even tried to sacrifice himself for Morty in [[A Rickle in Time]] and accepted death, that is until he saw a way out of dying. He cried when seeing pictures of Morty and remembering Morty as a newborn reaching out to him, when he was held captive by [[Evil Rick]], causing Evil Rick to mock him for his irrational attachment for Morty.

Rick and Morty have a strong bond, even though their relationship is strained due to Rick's cynicism, alcoholism, lack of conventional morality, and his tendency to push aside other members of the Smith family. Rick's carelessness is prevalent around Jerry, as he clearly doesn't respect him in any sense, and his relationship with [[Beth]] can be tumultuous at times. In "''[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]"'' and "''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]"'', [[Summer]] tags along on some of Rick's adventures. Rick initially had very little interest in her, but over time as the two spent time together, they have begun to develop a closer bond.

Rick is shown to have trouble taking orders from others. He is anti-totalitarian. As a result, Rick tends to dislike people with authority and government officials. He refuses to join the [[Council of Ricks]], because he views them as a government. He also calls the guards at Intergalactic Customs "robots" and claims that he doesn't respect them, as he deems them bureaucrats and doesn't like "being told where to go and what to do". Rick also has a great dislike of standardized education, claiming that school "isn't a place for smart people" and a "waste of time", and insists that things such as studying and homework are pointless and stupid.

Rick claims to be atheistic, but holds seemingly contradictory beliefs on religion. At one point, he tells Summer at the breakfast table in the pilot, "There is no God" - yet in the "[[Anatomy Park]]" episode, he tells the family "Do you realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our savior was born today-are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?" This comment was most likely sarcastic. He also quickly recognizes Mr. Needful as "the devil", and when he's under the impression that he is going to die while one of the other sixty-three Ricks is chasing after Morty's lost collar, actually kneels and prays, "Please God, if there's a Hell, please be merciful to me" (significantly, when no one is around). However, when the 1/64th Rick succeeds, he retracts his statement yells "Fuck you God, not today, bitch!" So, this allusion to religion may have just been a sarcastic comment. When the Ricks recombine in the presence of Summer and Morty, he once again says "I did it! There is no God! In your face!" It's possible this is just due to Rick's ego and his complete confidence in his own abilities.

Rick is most likely just atheistic making religious jokes and references, as in [[Never Ricking Morty]], it is revealed that the most uncharacteristic act Rick would do is resort and pray to Jesus Christ, as it crashes the entire "story train".

Despite his general disregard for others, he is shown to harbor deep emotional pain and sorrow, especially when it comes to his romantic relationships, such as with his former wife, Diane, and [[Unity]]. In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", it's revealed that Rick loved Diane dearly. Her death left a permanent mark on Rick, leading him to go on a decades-long quest for vengeance looking for the Rick who killed her. His inability to find the Rick responsible for her death has haunted Rick, causing him to become an alcoholic to cope with the pain and turning him into the nihilistic mad scientist he is now. Rick also carried a rather deep bond with Unity. After Rick freshest up during a long day with Unity's hive mind avatars, he returned to find Unity and all the planet's inhabitants gone, leaving behind a farewell note for Rick explaining that while Unity enjoyed its time with him, they could not be together. Unity calls out the fact that Rick mentally controls people, whereas Unity physically controls people, and that when they are together they bring out the worst in each other. They are too alike in the sense that they both turn others into mirror images of themselves (in Rick's case, he does so through bad influence rather than assimilation).
[[File:Rick And Morty Season 2 Episode 3 Ending|thumb|242x242px]]Dejected, heartbroken, and alone, Rick returned home, where he was confronted by Beth over the alien hidden in the basement lair, and asked him to keep no more alien pets. To Beth's (and the whole family's) shock, Rick simply conceded and retreated to the garage, where he clumsily attempted suicide with a makeshift death ray. He first killed a small, Cronenberg-like creature he kept, as it suffered from space AIDS and was living in agony. After Beth and Jerry let Blim Blam escape, Rick decides to euthanize the small alien. He thawed it out with a serum, comfortingly petting it as it cried out and screamed. He turned it to ash with the death ray before he sat down under it as it was about to fire again, only to pass out at the last moment while the death ray overloaded and fried. He remained slumped over his workbench, passed out, for the majority of the day and night. Rick and Morty then visited Beta 7's world, where Unity is staying. Rick lashed out at Beta 7, insisting to see Unity again, but Beta 7 informs Rick that he's considered a "hostile entity" and threatened to attack the two unless they left. Rick reluctantly does, at Morty's urging to go to the movies.

=== Substance Abuse ===
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-02h46m26s111.png|thumb|226x226px|

Rick, very drunk, tries to set off a neutrino bomb to "get a fresh start".]]
Originally, Rick's consumption of alcohol is presented more from a comedic viewpoint throughout the series' run, but in the Season 1 finale "''[[Ricksy Business]]''", [[Bird Person]] claims that Rick is in "great pain" (citing his catchphrase "wubba lubba dub dub" as meaning "''I am in great pain. Please help me.''" in Bird Person's language), and that he uses drugs and alcohol to numb himself. This is most likely due to his genius intelligence, nihilism, and the traumatizing effect that his continuous adventures may have on him, in the past and present (in "''[[Rick Potion No. 9]]''", Rick explains that the best method on how to deal with horrible events and outcomes is to "not think about it"). In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", it's shown that Rick began drinking copious amounts of alcohol to deal with the death of his wife and daughter as well as his failure to enact revenge upon their killer. 

=== Criminal Record ===
Throughout his numerous adventures with Morty, Rick has been shown to be ready and willing to disregard rules, laws and social norms if it is necessary to complete a task or escape a dangerous situation. Season one has Rick resorting to assault, battery, vandalism, smuggling, corruption of a minor, home invasion, reckless endangerment, terrorist threats, indecent exposure and even murder and arson in order to get the job done. The most common crimes committed are driving (or flying, in Rick's case) under the influence, drug abuse, and public intoxication.

In "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]," Rick is arrested by the [[Galactic Federation]]. His full criminal record is displayed on a monitor. Although in an alien language and unreadable, it is shown to be quite long. After he is placed under maximum security, another prisoner asks him "What are you in for?", to which Rick responds simply with "Everything". In "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]", Rick is arrested by the police, though they were under the control of [[Mr. Nimbus]]. 

*'''Assault:''' In the episode [[A Rickle in Time]], Rick started beating up a [[Fourth Dimensional Being|member]] of the [[Galactic Federation]]. Also in the pilot episode, Rick slaps a bystander alien in the face while fleeing from airport security, causing the alien to cry.
*'''Bioterrorism:''' In the episode [[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]], Rick made a dysfunctional love potion that spread a flu-like virus to everyone in the world, which he tried to fix by making another virus including praying mantis DNA that caused them to rip apart and mutate into giant praying mantis monsters. He attempted to fix this, by using another potion, but this only made them mutate again, [[Cronenbergs|cronenberging]] the entire world. He couldn't fix the mutations in the end, and just left the dimension with Morty, leaving all of the mutated humans behind.
*'''Breaking and Entering (Burglary):''' In the episode [[Lawnmower Dog]], Rick and Morty snuck into [[Mr. Goldenfold|Mr. Goldenfold's]] house while he was sleeping with the intent to brainwash him into giving Morty an A in math by invading Mr. Goldenfold's his dreams and incepting the idea.
*'''Cable Piracy:''' In the episodes [[Rixty Minutes]] and [[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]], Rick used an interdimensional cable box to stream an infinite amount of TV channels to his own television and the intergalactic hospital television.
*'''Cannibalism:''' Whilst in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth Rick is offered human flesh to eat by a post-apocalypse survivor. In an effort to dodge Morty's line of questioning he eats the meat.  
*'''Child Abuse:''' In most episodes of the series, Rick takes [[Morty]] along with him on all of his adventures, sometimes against his will. He often endangers his life as well as leaving him traumatized and mentally scarred by exposing him to scary and horrible things, such as [[Rick Potion No. 9|watching himself get killed and having to bury his own body]] or [[Meeseeks and Destroy|being forced to kill clones of his family]]. Morty is also the victim of lots of physical damage such as [[Pilot|breaking his legs in three places]]. In the episode "[[Total Rickall]]", Rick was even seen pushing Morty down a stairwell, simply as a practical joke, in a flashback montage, along with other ways Rick has mistreated him.
*'''Corpse Mutilation:''' In "[[Pickle Rick]]", he ripped apart the bodies of multiple rats and cockroaches and reassembled them into a suit.
*'''Driving Under Influence:''' Rick is drunk throughout the majority of most episodes of Rick and Morty and he's seen driving the [[List of Rick's inventions|space cruiser]] while he's drunk. Most notably in the [[Pilot]] episode, when Rick was visibly intoxicated while he flew the space cruiser with Morty and it almost led to him destroying the world.
*'''Felony Murder:''' Through the course of their adventures, many people have died as a direct or indirect result of Rick's actions. These deaths were usually during the commission of various other serious crimes he was committing, including felony evasion, smuggling, fraud, etc. Rick has also induced Morty to kill people for him, such as making him shoot the security guards to aid their escape in the [[Pilot]] episode.
*'''Genocide:''' In the episode [[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]], in order to keep the inhabitants of the microverse producing power for his spaceship, Rick smashes the container of the Miniverse. This causes the Miniverse, and the Teenyverse (a miniature universe within the Miniverse), and its two races of inhabitants to be wiped from existence.
*'''Human Cloning:''' In the episode [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]], it was revealed that Rick had been cloning and growing other versions of himself in vats in his bunker under the Smith Family garage. Although it remains unclear where cloning fits into Intergalactic law, it is at least illegal on Earth. It is also revealed that he cloned[[Clone Beth| Beth]] in "[[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]]". In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" it is revealed he is aware of - and possibly involved with - the mass cloning of Mortys at the Citadel to serve as sidekicks to Ricks. 
*'''Illegal Arms Dealing:''' In the episode "[[Mortynight Run]]", it was revealed that Rick has been selling weapons to a [[Krombopulos Michael|hitman]] for a long time, possibly also hiring him to kill various living beings. During a flashback in "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", a younger Rick sold large shipments of weapons to aliens in exchange for technology.
*'''Impersonation:''' When Rick's concoctions in the episode [[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]] mutated everyone on the planet not biologically related to Morty, the two traveled to a new dimension whose versions of them had just died in an explosion seconds before their arrival, and assumed their places as if nothing had happened. The corpses are currently still buried in the Smith's backyard. In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", he took control over the minds of many [[Gromflomites]] and members of [[SEAL Team Ricks|SEAL Team Rick]] and pretended to be them.
*'''Kidnapping and False Imprisonment:''' In the episode [[Auto Erotic Assimilation]], it was revealed that Rick had kidnapped an [[Blim Blam the Korblok|alien]] and kept it imprisoned in the basement against its own will for an amount of time, so that he could perform multiple tests on him.
*'''Murder:''' Outside of all of the hostile aliens he's killed, Rick has killed multiple innocent beings too. In the episode [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]], he ran around with an axe and killed several living versions of himself at different ages, including a baby, a young child, a young adult, and a full adult (although this could also fall under suicide, since they were his own clones). In the episode [[The Wedding Squanchers]], he killed a few more members of the [[Galactic Federation]]. In [[Look Who's Purging Now]], Rick and Morty partake in the Purge, and Rick kills a large number of government officials, although this was in a successful effort to remove the Purge.
*'''Prison Escape''' - In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", Rick broke out of the [[Galactic Federation Prison]], killed many of the [[SEAL Team Ricks|guards]], and finally, blew the entire place up, which in turn, must have freed any other prisoners, assuming any survived the explosion.
*'''Slavery: '''In the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy, it was revealed that Rick's spaceship battery was powered through a microverse, containing a whole planet of people forced to generate his power (originally through deception, later through fear of destruction).
*'''Smuggling:''' In the [[Pilot]] episode, Rick attempted to smuggle Mega Seeds past [[Intergalactic Customs]] security, by having Morty shove them up his butt to avoid the scanner detecting them. However, when the security guard told them they have a new machine that would detect things up there, Rick grabbed Morty and took off running from them.
*'''Terrorism:''' At the end of the episode [[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]], the inhabitants of the microverse are forced to step on gooble-boxes to power Rick's spaceship for fear of their planet being destroyed (see above: Slavery).
*'''Time Manipulation:''' In the episode [[A Rickle in Time]], Rick froze time for the equivalent of six months which caused time to start splitting and dividing multiple times, to the point where a [[Fourth Dimensional Being]] from the [[Galactic Federation]] came and tried to arrest him and his grandkids, also revealing that Rick may have done this before.
*'''Torture/Cruelty to Animals:''' At the end of the episode [[Auto Erotic Assimilation]], Rick revealed to be in possession a living, albeit frozen, being (unclear on the sentience of said being), which was horribly suffering after thawing out , and then he shocked it with a superheated ray, reducing it to ash. This was apparently to test the suicide machine he was using to end his own life.
*'''Vandalism/Arson:''' Rick destroyed multiple things in Intergalactic Customs in the [[Pilot]] episode. In the episode [[Something Ricked This Way Comes]], Rick had a [[Curse Purge Plus!|store]] and soon got bored of it, so he doused it with gasoline and lit it on fire while people were still in it.
*'''Treason/Rebellion:''' Prior to the start of the series, Rick was part of an organization that attempted to overthrow and destroy the Galactic Federation, along with his old comrades Squanchy and Birdperson.

[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-02h41m31s87.png|thumb|220x220px|Rick trying to comfort Morty after a run-in with Mr. Jellybean.]]
Though exploitative and demanding, Rick genuinely cares about his grandson and values their adventures together, making him one of the few Ricks to do so. He hesitates to outwardly show any love or appreciation however, making sure Morty doesn't get cocky. In "''[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]''", Rick seems genuinely surprised to find that the Morty he traveled with turned out to be a simulation, calling the [[Zigerions]] "diabolical sons of bitches", angry that they simulated his genitalia. He later becomes very drunk and threatens the real Morty with a knife, demanding to know whether or not he is another simulation before passing out. Morty is possibly the stabilizing influence in Ricks life that keep Rick from doing things that could end up doing a lot of harm though this does not work on many occasions. When Rick messes up, Morty is the one who convinces him to fix things.
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-03h28m32s141.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Rick and Morty burying their dead alternate selves.]]
Though Morty often frustrates him, Rick seems to get very upset at the idea of not being able to have adventures with Morty. He repeatedly attempts to help Morty escape from his other obligations to free up more time, in order to have him continue to be his assistant, such as pulling him out of school, manipulating [[Mr. Goldenfold]]'s dreams to give Morty A-grades in math, allowing Morty to lead an adventure of his own and creating a serum of vole oxytocin to force [[Jessica]] into loving Morty. Rick even goes through an elaborate heist setup that causes an unknowing Morty, who expressed interested in pitching a series idea for Netflix, to lose interest in the endeavour and continue agreeing to go on adventures with him.
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-03h49m20s197.png|thumb|220x220px|Rick and Morty fist-bumping.]]
Rick's (and all Ricks in other realities) reason for bringing Morty along with him is that all Ricks give off a very distinct brainwave pattern due to their genius, making them easy to track by their various enemies. The only way to camouflage the brainwave is to stand near someone with "complementary" brainwaves, which Rick calls "Morty Waves". Despite this, Rick seems to do things with Morty for reasons beyond needing camouflage, such as watching TV with him in "''[[Rixty Minutes]]''", taking him to an alien pawn shop in "''[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]''", and infiltrating Mr. Goldenfold's dreams in "''[[Lawnmower Dog]]''". It can also be pointed out that Rick can be spiteful to those that have genuinely upset Morty, such as in "''[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]''" when King Jellybean assaulted Morty, which not only caused Rick to attempt to cheer Morty up but also murder King Jellybean once he figured out what happened.

Rick believes that Morty is "as dumb as he (Rick) is smart", but still insists that Morty focus on science in "''[[Rick Potion No. 9]]''". He claims that Morty will "be like [Rick] someday", and that he has a "special mind". He also takes offense when Jerry insinuates that Morty has some kind of disability.

====[[Summer Smith|Summer]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-02h39m43s236.png|thumb|220x220px|Rick and Summer training to take revenge on Mr. Needful]]
Rick initially cared very little for and paid scarce attention to his granddaughter, saying her opinion meant "very little" to him. As time went on, however, the two began to bond and go on their own adventures, making her - in a sense - Rick's second sidekick. In "''[[Something Ricked This Way Comes]]''", Rick and Summer train themselves together to buff up and assault [[Mr. Needful]] for revenge. He has abandoned at least one Summer to die after he was forced to switch dimensions. However, he seems to care for his current version. He tends to acknowledge her input, stating he was almost proud her suggestion to destroy the federation.

Rick is also disgusted by the sight of a dream version of Summer dressed in sexual clothing in "''[[Lawnmower Dog]]''", and having her ask Rick and Morty to "make an inter-generational sandwich" makes him visibly disgusted.

====[[Beth Smith|Beth]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-02h51m12s212 (2).jpg|thumb|214x214px|Rick praising Beth's cooking.]]
It appears that Rick loves his daughter, and for the most part is kind to her. However, his treatment of her may just be a ploy to stay on her good side so he can continue to stay at her home and continue his adventures with Morty, although during "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]" many Ricks from different dimensions seem to like C-137 Rick's daughter, proving that he might have true feelings for his daughter.

Jerry claims that Beth was "raised like a reptile by a mentally ill scientist" in "[[Raising Gazorpazorp]]", suggesting that Rick's method of raising Beth was unorthodox.

Rick also treats Beth with more respect than he does the rest of the family. He often will curse at the other members or mock them but he is never seen doing this to Beth. He also has called her "Sweetie" a few times.

While the exact details have yet to be revealed, it can be assumed that Rick was absent from a majority of Beth's life due to his adventures and terrorist acts against the Galactic Federations, most notably with Birdperson and Squanchy. Rick only came back into Beth's life a short while before "[[Pilot]]", though he visited at least once during Morty's very early childhood. It is likely that she was unaware of this visit. During the events of [[Total Rickall]], Rick comforts Beth when she shoots Mr. Poopybutthole after thinking he was a parasite.

In "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", Morty lashes out on Beth for her distance towards him and Summer. He blames this on her relationship with Rick, telling her that she doesn't need to prove herself to be worthy of Rick's love by acting essentially just like him, as it is making her appear just as narcissistic and irresponsible. And that while she's trying to gain Rick's approval, she's hurting him and Summer.

Beth believed she needed to prove herself to Rick because of how rarely he ever tells her he loves her. He admits this to Jaguar in, "Pickle Rick." Rick also admitted in the same episode to Jerry that he believes Jerry impregnating Beth ruined her chances of being successful, and detests him for his detachment to his daughter. Beth's awareness of her mistreatment of her children may drive her farther away from Rick, as she may stop trying to get him to love her, and instead find solace in her relationship with her kids.

In [[The ABC's of Beth]], Rick behaves with Beth similarly to how he behaves with Morty and Summer, deriding her and her actions. However, he sympathized with her when she admitted she was similar to him and suggested she go off into the universe to explore it just as he did.

In [[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]], it's also revealed that Beth gave Rick the responsibility of choosing for her, something that caused Rick visible stress for having to make such a large decision. Unsure of what the right decision is, Rick decides to forgo responsibility and switch the two Beths around so he doesn't know which Beth is the clone because he erased his memory. Rick later goes out of way to save his daughter, successfully freeing both. At the end, neither Beth want to know who is the original an both share a dislike of Rick. Also, Rick finally acknowledges his terrible parenting after seeing his own actions in a recording.

In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", it's shown that Rick actually cares for Beth much more than he let on. As it happens, Rick's original Beth and Diane were both killed by a bomb sent by an alternate Rick. The deaths of her and Diane have deeply haunted Rick and caused him to search the multiverse to find and kill the Rick responsible for their deaths. This cements how much Rick cares for his daughter and how driven he was to avenge their deaths.

====[[Jerry Smith|Jerry]]====
[[File:Vlcsnap-2015-01-31-02h54m00s151.png|thumb|220x220px|Rick and Jerry, after being scammed by the Zigerions.]]
Rick has no respect for Jerry and uses any chance he gets to demean or humiliate him, whether it's constantly reminding him of his failing marriage to Beth or mocking his low intelligence. Rick seems to somewhat resent the fact that Jerry had sex with Beth, and got her pregnant (with Summer) at seventeen. 

Despite the fact that Rick sees Jerry as an idiot, he still helps him with his requests (providing him with an intelligence enhancer for [[Snuffles]], the [[Meeseeks Box]], and the parallel timeline goggles), and asks that the Rick Officers from the Council of Ricks "unfreeze his daughter's idiot" in "''[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]''". However, it may simply be a way of him getting Jerry to stop bothering him or not bother him in the first place. 

In "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]" while the alternate Ricks are waiting at Rick C-137's house, Rick accurately predicts that the others Ricks "won't be able to resist" messing with Jerry, meaning that Rick hating Jerry is evident for almost all Ricks in every reality. 

Also, in "[[Mortynight Run]]", a daycare was set up by a Rick to allow other Ricks to deposit their respective Jerrys. At first glance, it would seem the Jerrys enjoyed their time there but the more grim reality is revealed when a couple of Jerrys claimed they are abandoned as "their Ricks never returned". It's also revealed though that they are free to leave whenever they want as holding them against their will would be illegal. They just choose not to because they can't handle it out there because they're Jerrys and they don't know how to survive space. This can be seen as Rick at least not wanting Jerry to be killed since a version of him set up a daycare filled with stuff Jerry enjoys.

Despite his apparent hatred of Jerry, in "[[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]," he was just as horrified as the rest of the family at seeing him shot dead by the guards, though was right back to his usual demeanor towards his son-in-law when he was revived by advanced alien technology. In the episode "[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]" he actually comforts Jerry after Jerry finds out the best day of his life was a simulation.

In "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", Morty convinces Rick to take Jerry on a "pity adventure" to keep him from committing suicide. Rick later admits to Jerry that he believes when he impregnated Beth, it ruined her chances of being successful, and he detests him for his detachment to his daughter. Dan Harmon has stated that Rick only hates Jerry by circumstance, and throughout the episode, they seemed to have been spending a good time together. Towards the end of the episode, Rick and Jerry's souls spend what feels like decades together when they are detached from reality, flying into a wormhole. At the end of the episode, they both learn to respect each other more.

In the post credits scene of [[The ABC's of Beth|''The ABC's of Beth'']], Rick gives Jerry a message on his answering machine, telling him he took care of Jerry's problem (his ex-girlfriends [[Kiara]]'s ex-boyfriend [[Trandor]], who also messaged him threatening his life), and telling Jerry he's looking out for him. This implies that Rick did this of his own accord, or was simply asked by Morty or Summer to look out for him. During ''[[The Rickchurian Mortydate]]'', Rick was dismayed to hear that Jerry and Beth have reconciled. When confronting them, he admits he was planning to kill Jerry but gave up because of the latter's importance to his family. Although Jerry was shocked, he was happy Rick acknowledged that. Rick was later annoyed that Beth is now more defensive of her husband.

In [[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]], Rick saves Jerry and Beth from [[Tammy Guetermann]]. He forbade their therapist from entering the ship, since she wasn't in his family, meaning he sees Jerry as such.

==== [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]] ====
Initially, there was very little known about the relationship between Rick and his former wife, Diane Sanchez. At first, it's implied that the relationship between Rick and Diane didn't work out. In Rick Potion #9, Rick tells Morty that he was part of a failed marriage. Then, in "The Wedding Squanchers", Rick remarks "I couldn't make a marriage work and I can turn a black hole into a sun". This further implies that Rick's relationship with his wife was not healthy or sustainable. 

In "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption|The Rickshank Rickdemption"]], Rick shows a memory of his past to [[Cornvelious Daniel]], where he is shown to be happy with both Diane and Beth. As he watches the memory of his wife and daughter being killed by a bomb, Rick is haunted by their deaths. At first, Rick states that this was a completely fabricated origin story. However, in "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", it's revealed that the memory of her demise was actually true. From this, it is shown that Rick did love Diane dearly and contrary to his statements actually appeared to have a healthy marriage. Her death left a lasting impact on Rick, leading him to go on a quest to find the Rick who killed her and Beth. His failure at finding the Rick who killed them has further traumatized him and is what led him to become the alcoholic nihilist he is now. Furthermore, unlike with Beth or the rest of the Smith family, Rick never seems to have attempted to find an alternate version of her, instead remaining driven on finding the Rick that killed the original Diane. This demonstrates how much Diane meant to Rick and how in his eyes, Diana is irreplaceable.

===Friends===
==== [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] ====
Like the rest of his family, Rick has a good relationship with Mr. Poopybutthole; during the events of [[Total Rickall]], their relationship takes a blow when Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole after thinking he was a parasite. Rick tended to him after he was shot, telling him to hang on. Although Mr. Poopybutthole survived, he didn't want to speak with Rick or the family. By the time of "[[One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty]]", they are at least back on speaking terms as seen when they agree to a heist together.

===='''[[Birdperson]]'''====
Rick considers Birdperson to be his best friend, having done lots of things together - like being a part of the same band, committing terrorism against the Galactic Federation together. Birdperson attended Rick's party in the episode [[Ricksy Business]]. He showed concern for Rick's well being, telling Morty that "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" means "I am in great pain, please help me". He invited Rick to his wedding in the episode [[The Wedding Squanchers]]. In the same episode, Rick was shown to be very torn apart when he saw Birdperson die. Birdperson also has a picture of Rick holding a baby Morty, alluding to an unknown history with an alternate Morty.

In "[[Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri]]", he kills Tammy for killing his best friend. When Rick learned of Birdperson's fate as a cyborg, Rick was upset and tried to cheer him up by revealing his killing of Tammy but this caused him to be attacked. Prior to this, Rick called Birdperson his best friend but did mention he wondered who would win in a fight between them, as Birdperson called him a terrible friend. Birdperson would have killed Rick if he hadn't been saved by his family and Birdperson was shut off. In the end, Rick salvaged his incapacitated friend and keeps him in the garage lab, presumably to help him but he is wise to keep the latter shut off until he is calmed.

In "[[Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort]]", Rick is left home alone and finally finishes repairing Birdperson, fully removing his cybernetic enhancements. Whilst his body is repaired, Birdperson's mind is damaged, causing Rick to enter it. During this time, we see several memories revealing how Rick and Birdperson met and how their friendship developed. The two first met at some sort of alien music festival, where they also met [[Squanchy]] after getting high. The three became friends after this and went on to fight the Galactic Federation, eventually going on to participate in The Battle of Blood Ridge. Rick and Birdperson fought together and won the battle with ease. After the fighting was done, Rick offered to take Birdperson away from the fighting to an alternate universe, an offer he apparently shared with almost nobody; Birdperson was the exception because he mattered to Rick. Birdperson turned it down, stating their relationship was not worth his integrity. This clearly hurt Rick, who left whilst insulting Birdperson. 

Memory Rick, who was observing this interaction alongside our Rick, questioned why the latter would bother risking his life for Birdperson after what he did. Rick tells Memory Rick "because you love him" which, of course, means Rick himself loves Birdperson. This is a rare instance of Rick expressing his affection for someone. Notably, it was done without the assistance of intoxication. 

Once Rick escaped a now healed Birdperson's mind, the two had a brief conversation. Earlier in the episode, Rick had discovered Birdperson and Tammy had a child who was now locked up by the Galactic Federation; the memory had been removed from his mind by them during his time as Phoenixperson. However, it appears Rick wasn't planning on telling Birdperson, as having a child would prevent him from spending time with Rick. Whilst this shows the lengths Rick will go to just to hang out with Birdperson, it causes the latter to leave disappointed, telling Rick he'll see him when he sees him.

==Trivia==
*Rick's appearance is meant to parody [[wikipedia:Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] from ''[[wikipedia:Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]''
*Rick has digestive problems, as revealed in [https://youtu.be/Hn0_1XBBJGI ELDERS REACT TO RICK AND MORTY].

* Rick and Morty were originally from ''[[The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti]]'', [[Justin Roiland]]'s original ''Back to the Future'' parody. Also the names of the characters sound similar to the names "Doc and Marty," the main characters of the trilogy.
*Rick has a fear of pirates.

*His last name, "[[Wikipedia:Sánchez|Sanchez]]" is Hispanic in origin. In the audio commentary for the episode "[[Auto Erotic Assimilation]]", Rick was confirmed to be of Hispanic descent. Exactly where is unknown.
**Justin Roiland claims that he considers Rick's cultural background "irrelevant". <ref>https://youtu.be/ANE1Bz7Qk0c?t=15m45s</ref>
*According to himself, he has the hardest working liver in the galaxy.
*Rick (C-137) is one of the only Ricks in existence shown to care about his Morty, as he starts crying when he is shown various memories of Morty, though he outwardly dismisses it as "being allergic to dipshits.". This is further proven when he was ready to sacrifice himself for his Morty's sake during Season 2 episode 1 when they were in the Schrödingers cat field.
**[[Wasp Rick]] also cares about his Morty and family.
*In "[[Auto Erotic Assimilation]]," Rick is revealed to be an open pansexual.<ref>http://therickandmortyassistant.tumblr.com/post/127618596788/kind-of-an-odd-question-but-was-it-ever-said-in</ref><ref>http://therickandmortyassistant.tumblr.com/post/127569377143/someones-probably-asked-this-before-but-rick</ref><ref>http://therickandmortyassistant.tumblr.com/post/127263901753/hey-so-whats-your-opinion-on-ricks-sexuality</ref><ref>http://ehayes87.tumblr.com/post/127266776121/hey-so-whats-your-opinion-on-ricks-sexuality</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Q9bsQdx4k&t=4m15s</ref>
*It's possible that Rick had a complicated relationship with his father because he wanted a stand of men who remotely resembled his father to cheer him on while he had sex with Unity. In "Pocket Mortys" the scientist known as Rick says how he heard that Rick's mother was never satisfied by any actions of Rick or those of his siblings. It's possible they were not very supportive of Rick and weren't satisfied with his achievements. None of Rick's siblings, nieces, or nephews have ever been mentioned or seen on the show.
*In "[[A Rickle in Time]]," he briefly mentions that if he dies in a cage, he loses a bet. What this bet is wagering or who it's with is never stated.
*A flashback gag in "[[Total Rickall]]" shows Rick as being interested in getting a special edition Link Between Worlds 3DS XL and asking Nintendo for sponsorship. However, Rick actually owns a black 3DS that he is seen playing in "[[Look Who's Purging Now]]".
*Rick's Global Bank Card number is [[Tel:1234 1234 1234 1234|1234 1234 1234 1234]]
*Rick can write with his right hand,<ref>http://i.imgur.com/6RcIzue.png</ref> shoot with his right hand<ref>http://i.imgur.com/Nrd2F0e.png</ref>, and sometimes holds objects with his right,<ref>[[:File:Meeseeks and Destroy 3.png]]</ref> but seems to favor using his left. He is often seen holding drinks with his left,<ref>[[:File:Rick-and-Morty1.jpg]]</ref> shooting with his left,<ref>[[:File:RickMorty-Trailer-070115.jpg]]</ref> and even plays guitar with his left in a framed photo in Bird Person's house,<ref>http://i.imgur.com/o0GXGbA.jpg</ref> with the exclusion of "Big Trouble in Little Sanchez", where he plays guitar right-handed.<ref>http://www.altpress.com/images/uploads/news/Rick_and_Morty.jpg</ref> With this evidence, it seems that Rick may be Ambidextrous.
*Rick breaks the [[Fourth Wall Jokes|fourth-wall]] more than any other character in the series. In fact, he seems to be the only character fully aware of the fact that he's in a TV show, sometimes directly addressing the audience.
*Politically, Rick’s Social Values seem to be completely anti-authoritarian (Anarchist), as he opposes bureaucracy and the Galactic Federation as a total. When it comes to his economic values, he seems to not have a preference for left wing or right wing economics, even though, at many instances, he has been critical of capitalism with the episode “Never Ricking Morty“ being a major example. Because of Rick's hyper anti-authoritarianism and seemingly criticalness of capitalism, some speculate he's an Egoist.
*Rick's prisoner ID code while incarcerated is AE-3852-I.<ref>https://prison.galacticfederation.com/prisoners/AE-3852-I</ref>
*In the episode, "[[Get Schwifty]]", Rick is shown to be the bass guitarist in a band called "[[The Flesh Curtains]]" performed by Rick, Squanchy, and Birdperson. Although the band is never mentioned in the show, Birdperson keeps a photograph of the band on his wall. Rick's guitar playing skill is also evidenced in the episode, "[[Big Trouble in Little Sanchez]]", as Tiny Rick plays his own [[Tiny Rick Song]] on the guitar.
*Rick is currently the only character to have his consciousness transferred into a series of different bodies (including different versions of himself in the multiverse, clones of himself, and [[Cornvelious Daniel]])
**Rick's current body is not even his own. His original body was killed during the events of "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]".
*Rick has a planet fetish.
* Jerry speculates that Rick may have more children besides Beth, due to his promiscuous lifestyle. This is later proven when Rick has a half horse human hybrid child with [[Poñeta]] named Foal.
*Rick has hinted that he has autism. Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon is also on the autism spectrum.
*In the third season's premiere, Rick is referred to as the smartest being in the universe by the Gromflomite guards. This marks the first case of his title of The Smartest Man in the Universe being used. Rick was never called this in previous seasons. After this episode, however, several characters and even Rick himself refer to him as such.
*During the episode "[[Mort Dinner Rick Andre]]," many things about Rick are revealed.
** Rick has a nemesis called [[Mr. Nimbus]]. Mr. Nimbus seems to have vague connections to Rick's past.
** Apparently, Rick originally had an assistant named Kyle. Nothing is known regarding Kyle, except that Mr. Nimbus prefers him over Morty.
** Mr. Nimbus refers to Rick as Richard, possibly revealing this as his first name, with Rick merely being a nickname. However, Rick himself never confirms this.
*Rick C-137 is atypical and unique from other Ricks in the show. 
**He did not have his own Smith family, as Beth C-137 was murdered as an infant by another version of Rick. Instead, he moves in with another Smith family abandoned by their version of himself, pretending he had returned.
**Rick C-137 does not have a 'Morty C-137', as the Morty we follow through the show is from the Cronenberged Dimension. The only other Rick confirmed to not have his own biological Morty is [[Doofus Rick]].
**Many of the Ricks we see live amongst each other on the Citadel of Ricks, as a capitalist-like civilisation, with varying professions, social hierarchies and a governing democracy. However, C-137 is hostile to other Ricks, and regularly expresses hatred and apathy for governments and societies in general. He refused to join the Council of Ricks, instead becoming an inter-galactic rebel and a fugitive terrorist ("terror-rick"). Additionally, he has likely murdered hundreds of thousands of versions of himself - as shown in his backstory in "Rickmurai Jack", and during his destruction of the first Citadel of Ricks, in "The Rickshank Rickdemption."
*It has been confirmed in "Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort" that Rick was born naturally with light blue hair.
