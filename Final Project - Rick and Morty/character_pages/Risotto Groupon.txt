'''Risotto Groupon''' is an antagonist who appeared inÂ [[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]. He is the assistant general manager of the restaurant at the [[Immortality Field Resort]], and is the apparent leader of [[Pom Poms|his species]] there.

==Biography==
Some time before the events of [[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]], Risotto Groupon's kingdom was usurped by enemies that were equipped by Rick. He wants revenge against Rick, and tries to recruit Jerry to help him, informing him of a gap in the immortality field on the Whirly Dirly roller coaster ride. After Rick survives the attempt on his life, Risotto catches up to him and Jerry on a commercial space-liner, whose security injected synaptic dampeners into Rick to subdue violent tendencies and controversial thought, as well as use of his "Class-A or above" cybernetic implants. Jerry holds Risotto off long enough for the space-liner to enter a wormhole, sending the three of them into a mind-altering trip through space-time. The trip through the wormhole takes long enough to allow Rick's synaptic dampeners to wear off, allowing him to utilize his cybernetic implants, quickly disarming Risotto, and killing him.

== Appearance==
Risotto Groupon is an round poodle-like alien with light blue fur, pinkish skin, three fingers, and a couple small stalks sticking out of his head, with light blue fur tufts at the end. Risotto seems to be a larger member of his species.
