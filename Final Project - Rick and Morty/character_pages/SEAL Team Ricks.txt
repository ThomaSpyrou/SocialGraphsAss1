'''SEAL Team Ricks''' was a team dispatched by the [[Council of Ricks]] to retrieve and kill [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]], who in turn killed the majority. 

== History ==
SEAL Team Ricks was sent out on mission to break into the [[Galactic Federation Prison]] holding Rick C-137 and assassinate him before any Citadel secrets could fall into Federation hands. They came in through the ceiling and shot every [[Gromflomites|Gromflomite]] in the interrogation room dead, losing one member, before Rick D-99 walked up to Rick C-137's restrained body and shot it in the head. Shortly after, he was caught off guard by Rick C-137 in [[Cornvelious Daniel]]'s body who swapped their minds and used D-99's weapon-equipped body to kill off the other SEAL Team Ricks. Rick D-99's body was later, presumably, destroyed onboard a ship after Rick C-137 swapped minds with [[Commander Rick]], proclaimed the Rick on the ship to be a spy and ordered it blown up.

== Trivia ==
*The name is a play on [[Wikipedia:SEAL Team Six|SEAL Team Six]], an offensive military special operations unit responsible for the death of [[Wikipedia:Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]].
*The bald Rick wearing earrings was never seen alive again after initially appearing with the other Ricks, as he was killed off-screen by one of the Gromflomites at some point.
