'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the mythologs of [[Jerry Smith]]. He appears in the episode "[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]''"''. When Jerry says "Beth, it's me, your husband. I'm here to save you, or my name isn't Jerry Smith!" [[Beth]]'s new mental image of egocentric Jerry comes marching out of the mytholog machine.

*When the muscular Jerrys and the mytholog Jerrys are fighting the Self-Congratulatory Jerrys do nothing but just shake hands and congratulate making them totally useless.
