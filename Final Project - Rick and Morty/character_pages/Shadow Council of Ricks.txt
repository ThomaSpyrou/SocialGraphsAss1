The '''Shadow Council of Ricks''', also known as the '''Brotherhood Counsel''' was a secret cabal forming the true (shadow) government ruling over [[the Citadel]]. The Shadow Council predated the normal [[Council of Ricks]] and consisted of the most powerful Ricks in the Citadel. All but two of its nine members were summarily ordered to be executed by [[Evil Morty]] shortly after his election triumph, their corpses ejected into space to join other Ricks and Mortys who were deceased.

==Membership==
The Ricks on the Shadow Council apparently represented major business concerns of the Citadel. Each Rick owned and operated large corporations. Some Ricks were reminiscent of either real-world industry captains (such as the two surviving members, who look like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs) or global upper-class stereotypes.

===Known Representatives and Industries===
*[[Rick D. Sanchez III]] - [[Simple Rickâ€™s Wafer Cookie factory]]
*[[Garment District Rick]] - Fashion
*[[Sheikh Rick]] - Fuel Energy
