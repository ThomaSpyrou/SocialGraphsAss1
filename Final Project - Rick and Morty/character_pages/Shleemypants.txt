He is an alien who works as a multidimensional police officer, keeping the multiverse safe from all benders of space time. He confronts [[Rick]] about a stolen time crystal after Morty and Summer's indecisiveness splits time and brings them to uncertainty. His weapon of choice is a live, slug-like creature named [[Chris]].

He later appears in [[Rattlestar Ricklactica]], where he is seen receiving a phone call about time traveling snakes. He, along with another fourth dimensional cop, travel back in time and beat up a caveman snake. This causes all of the snakes to eat their tails like an ouroboros, making them disappear and ending the invasion.

==Appearance==
Shleemypants is a red, vascular monster who appears to be made of internal flesh with several small little hairs on it. His only facial feature is a giant mouth full of crooked and disordered yellowish teeth. He has long arms with three fingers and a thumb on each hand (described as vestigial, yet still functional) and no legs, his body simply floating off the ground. He wears a long tan robe that is very ripped and torn at the trim and ends of the sleeves. He also wears a brown satchel, used for storing his equipment.
==Personality==
Shleemypants is a very sassy, trash-talking creature who does not take shit from anyone and gets very rude and even violent when angered. He talks and acts like a stereotypical "angry black man". He enjoys using the word "ass" as substitute for other curses. He even acts like this towards other members of his species, cussing one colleague out for being lazy, although he gets the same from said colleague.
==Weaknesses==
His omniscience is both a strength and a weakness, as Rick and his family simply created many overlapping timelines to overwhelm and defeat him.
== Apperances ==
=== [[Season 2]] ===
* "[[A Rickle in Time]]"
=== [[Season 4]] ===
* "[[Rattlestar Ricklactica]]"
==Trivia==
*He is a parody of the Time Eaters from ''The Langoliers''.
*As seen in the Blu-ray extras animatics, an earlier draft of [[A Rickle in Time]] showed Shleemypants as a customer service agent instead of a timecop. He works for the company that provided the time freezing device Rick uses. While Rick is knocked unconscious Summer and Morty call customer service hotline which is why Shleemypants appears.
