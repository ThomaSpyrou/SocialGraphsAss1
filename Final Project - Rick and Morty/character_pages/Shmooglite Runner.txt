'''Shmooglite Runner''' appears in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]". It is a yellow carnivorous creature that [[Rick]] uses to transport himself and [[Jerry]] to a spaceport so they can return to Earth.



==History==
When Rick saves Jerry from the [[Gibble Snake]]'s stomach, he says that he needs a living organism covered in Gibble Snake slime to attract a Shmooglite Runner. The Shmooglite Runner attacks Jerry, but Rick quickly tranquilizes and tames it. The Shmooglite Runner then escorts both of them to back to a space port more than 20 miles away. Rick rides on its back while Jerry is in a pouch where its testicles are slapping his face. It's unknown what happens to the Shmooglite Runner afterwards. Its rotting corpse was later seen in a dream sequence after Rick, Jerry, and Risotto Groupon are influenced by the [[Portal Technology|wormhole]], indicating that it might have been killed once they reached the spaceport.

== Appearance ==
Based on the only individual seen, Shmooglite Runners are large bipedal creatures with traits similar to that of snails and dromaeosaurs. Like a snail, its eyes are held high above its body. Its body is long and dinosaur-like, ending in a long tail. Its legs are digitigrade, ending in two toes. The mouth of the creatures consists of four flaps, which when opened reveal dozens of backwards-facing needle-like teeth. The creatures throat has two pairs of spiked mandibles, possibly for pulling prey into the gullet. The creature also has several orifices on its mouth flaps that function as nostrils, giving it an incredible sense of smell. The individual seen in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]" appeared to be male, as its testicles could be seen hanging beneath its body.  

==Trivia==
*The Shmooglite Runner's gender may be male because it has testicles.
*The design of its mouth is similar to the mouth of the Demogorgon from the horror show ''Stranger Things''.
