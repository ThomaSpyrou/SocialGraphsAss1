'''Shnoopy Bloopers''' is an alien friend of [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]'s who made his first appearance in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]." He is the owner of an unnamed restaurant in the [[Immortality Field Resort]]. 

==Biography==
Shnoopy Bloopers initially attacked Rick with a spear and killed him, before being killed in turn with a beer bottle in the neck. However, both were resurrected due to the immortality field and he revealed himself to be quite friendly and acquainted to Rick, welcoming him with free food and drink.

==Appearance==
Shnoopy is a pink-skinned alien almost as tall as Rick. His large flat nose is on top of his head, his yellow-green eyes on the tip of a tentacle-like extension on both sides of his head, and a stubble around his mouth. He dresses in an orange collar shirt with a gray shirt underneath and keeps his blue pants up with a brown belt.
