}}'''Shrimp Rick''' is a version of [[Rick Sanchez]] that exists in a shrimp world.

== Personality ==
When he is first seen, he appears to be a kind man by helping Rick and asking if he was okay after his cloning experience. Shrimp Rick also started to joke with his counterpart on their crustacean bodies and being curious about his world. However, when he learned that Rick was not a fascist like him he turned on him.

Like the other Ricks, he often belittles his grandson by insulting him with his counterpart.

== Biography ==
When Rick first found Rick C-137, he came to help him and waved off the usage of his one of [[Operation Phoenix]] clones, noting that he had dozens of backup clones. After the two scared away [[Shrimp Morty]], they discussed the unlikelihood of shrimp and primate dwellings being the same before Rick C-137 voiced his relief that Rick was a shrimp instead of a fascist. 

Awkwardly, Rick revealed himself to be a fascist, sending C-137 running. Rick ends up being chased by fascist Shrimps and ends up dead before reviving.

Shrimp Rick makes a brief cameo in the multiverse scene of [[Rickmurai Jack]].
