}}'''Simon''' is a guy who works for The Pentagon and appeared in the episode [[Get Schwifty]].

==Biography==
The original Simon presumably became a Cronenberg in the [[Cronenberged dimension]].

He was summoned to The Pentagon by [[The President]] in order to handle the [[Cromulons|Cromulon]] that had just appeared in the sky. He told the President how every broadcaster on the planet was beaming out information on string theory, world history, the human genome and more, but was cut short by [[General Nathan]]. When Nathan presented his idea, launching nuclear missiles at the giant head, Simon was the first to speak against it. When [[Rick]] revealed the Cromulon to waiting for a hit song, Simon suggested Vivaldi, which Rick shut down and called him "Frasier". He later told the President that the magnetic poles were about to reverse due to the presence of the giant head.
