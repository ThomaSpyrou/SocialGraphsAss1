*"[[Tales From the Citadel]]"

==Trivia==
*It has been theorized that this Rick originated from a reality in which he looked into the microscope that [[Mr. Needful]] gave him.
*This Rick is similar to both [[Dumb Rick]], from Issue 3 of the ''[[Rick and Morty (comic series)|Rick and Morty]]'' comic series, and the Morty Rick avatar from the [[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]] game ''[[Pocket Mortys]]''.
**It is possible that they're all the same Rick, as it is possible that he went to the Citadel after murdering [[Genius Morty|his Morty]], and was treated as a Morty due to sharing their intelligence.

* He seems to be a commentary on how modern disabled school children are treated.
