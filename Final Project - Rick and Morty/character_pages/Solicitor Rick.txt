'''Solicitor Rick''' is a version of [[Rick Sanchez]] who first appeared in the episode "[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]." He attempted to sell Morty dazzlers to Rick, who was on his way to a trial, but to no avail. He was at the Citadel during the events of "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]."

==Biography==
He was seen on the [[Citadel of Ricks]], confronting Rick, [[Morty]], and the [[Council of Ricks]] when they were walking to the courtroom. He was trying to sell them Morty dazzlers; some sort of fancy necklaces. They kept shutting him out, but he continued to pester them about it, annoying them.

In [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], after the Citadel of Ricks was teleported into the [[Galactic Federation]] Prison, he was one of the Ricks fighting against loose prisoners and [[Gromflomites]]. He managed to kill a [[Narduarvians|Narduarvian]] and a Gromflomite guard before he was thrown at a Rick Guard and out of sight.

==Appearance==
Solicitor Rick has the same appearance as most other Ricks with the exception for his manner of dressing, where he wears a dark gray suit, light gray shirt and a striped tie. He is also shown to smile a lot more than regular Ricks. He can be seen walking around with Morty dazzlers hanging from his hands.

==Personality==
Rick puts on a smile and a good mood when he tries to make a sale, but is quickly saddened when brushed off by [[Rick Sanchez]]. The fact that he tried to make a sale with a prisoner could point to him not making a lot of sales, as with his reaction to being rejected. He has shown to be proficient with a gun when the Citadel was teleported into the Galactic Federal Prison.
