The '''Space Cruiser''' is an interdisciplinary vehicle designed and built by engineer-scientist Rick Sanchez with the aim of making space travel an easier and faster task for him. In the "[[Pilot]]", Rick said that he built it out of stuff he found in the garage , although in "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" it is shown that Rick created the spaceship in his youth.
==Engine and abilities==
===Microverse-based powercell===

The [[Microverse|Microverse-based powercell]] is the main powercell of the vehicle, whom in-habitants possess a culture based on the belief that the vehicle owner, Richard Sánchez, is an extraterrestrial lifeform with the sole purpose of spreading his knowledge in electricity. The powercell produces the energy required to power the vehicle's engine, while also distributing a minor part of it to its in-habitants.

=== Dark-matter based engine ===
The engine processors located on both sides of the ship are connected to a supply of concentrated dark-matter, a powerful fuel discovered by Richard Sánchez with the purpose of powering his engine. The engines are equipped to support the energy charge of the fuel while also distributing it to the rest of the systems.

==Trivia==
*In the Pilot episode, Rick asks Morty if he likes the Space Cruiser and remarks he made it out of stuff he found in the garage. This implies Rick only built the ship around the time of the series inception.
**The Space Cruiser is also shown to have a sail attached to the back of it in only this episode. It is never seen again after the Pilot.
**In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]" it is shown that Rick invented the space cruiser in his youth. Since the Pilot is not quite canonical, for that he is a Pilot episode, the information that Rick invented the space cruiser at the time of the beginning of the series is outdated.
***Seeing how the cruiser was destroyed when he crashed into the house during the flashback of the episode, it's possible that what mean was he '''rebuilt''' it with stuff he found in the garage.
*The space cruiser was partially inspired by the spaceship that Calvin's imaginary character, Spaceman Spiff owned in the comic strip ''Calvin And Hobbes.''
