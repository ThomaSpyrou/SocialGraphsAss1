'''Squeeb''' is a child of [[Gaia]] and [[Reggie]].

==Biography==

After Gaia gave birth to Squeeb, he was raised through [[Rick Sanchez]] and [[Beth Smith]]'s sorting factory and was categorized as "unproductive", being dumped out into the mud. There, he met [[Jerry Smith]], who taught him and all the other unproductives about camping. Squeeb built a house out of wood with guttering and a door, but Jerry got angry and pulled it down, explaining that if "indoors" existed, then no one would want to go camping.

Later, the unproductives waged war on the rest of Gaia and Reggie's children, led by Jerry. When Reggie was killed, his massive body fell from the sky and killed most of his children.
