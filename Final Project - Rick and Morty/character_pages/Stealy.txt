'''Stealy''' is a character seen in "[[Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate]]". He stars in ''[[The Adventures of Stealy]]'', a TV series where he goes through locations stealing numerous items and determining their value in [[Brapple]]s.

==Trivia==
* He looks very similar to [[Mr. Poopybutthole]].
* Stealy has been seen using rags doused with chemicals to incapacitate people (may be chloroform to put them to sleep, or possibly something more lethal).
* His arms can extend and retract a great distance.
* He lives in a "special safe room" which is likely a bunker where he stores all his stolen items.
* The items featured in the segment include a bag of chips ([[Bobbish]]), a [[Plumbus]], and some crushed red party cups, even though we never saw him steal those things.
