== Biography ==
The original Steve presumably became a Cronenberg in the [[Cronenberged dimension]].

Steve is a presidential aide first seen in the episode [[Mortyplicity]]. He is alerting [[the President]] of a confluence of [[Rick Sanchez|Rick Sanchezes]] killing each other over the American Southwest. The President chooses to ignore the problem instead asking how many states voted for him. Steve then tries to tell him what the purpose of the electoral college is but he is interrupted by the President, who claims that it is used to preserve slavery. The President then tells Steve to bring him a Diet Coke.
