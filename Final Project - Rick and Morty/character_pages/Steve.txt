==Biography==
The original Steve presumably became a Cronenberg inÂ the [[Cronenberged dimension]].

In "[[The Rickchurian Mortydate]]", [[The President]] sent two of his secret service members, including Steve, to summon [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]]. Steve and his co-worker traveled all the way from [[The White House]] to [[Smith Residence]], only to find out that Rick and Morty could teleport there in seconds, using the [[Portal Gun|portal gun]]. Steve questioned why they went through that entire ordeal just to do that, and his co-worker cut him off, telling him that he knows just as little as he does, being merely an employee who works for The President.
