==Biography==
Before being put under [[Unity|Unity's]] control, Steven was a registered sex offender, but after Unity had taken control over him, he became a nice, civilized man who obeys the rules and lives a normal life. [[Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]] both started protesting against Unity taking away the free will of everyone on the planet and confronted Steven, specifically, trying to get his true self to hear her and set himself free. He eventually did get set free, and when he did, he creepily took a picture of Summer and Morty's feet.
