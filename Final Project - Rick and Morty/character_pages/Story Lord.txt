'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the conductor of the story train and the main antagonist of the episode "[[Never Ricking Morty]]".

==Biography==
In [[Never Ricking Morty]], he appears as the conductor of the Story Train, trapping [[Rick]] and [[Morty]], and beating them up with the intention forcing them to live through anthologies as a way of using their marketability and entertainment value to power the train enough for it to break the fifth wall.

This fails, however, when Rick undercuts his own insincerity by praying to [[Jesus Christ]], with the help of Morty, causing the marketability and entertainment value Story Lord was siphoning to plummet. Story Lord attempts to stop their invocation, but Christ himself soon arrives and overpowers him, allowing Rick and Morty to escape.

He is later seen walking with Jesus on a beach. After Story Lord explains the narrative and mythological origins of Jesus Christ's identity, the Christian icon utilizes his phenomenal power. It is unclear what this power did to himself and Story Lord, though it caused the now toy-sized Story Train to crash in the [[Smith Residence]].

==Appearance==
Story Lord appears to be human. He has gray hair, signifying his age and is incredibly shredded, possessing bulging muscles and a six pack.

==Personality==
Story Lord is focused, grandiose, and smug. He is disciplined and competent, both physically and mentally. 

==Relationships==

===[[Rick Sanchez]]===
Story Lord holds a personal grievance against Rick Sanchez, due to the latter's over-indulgence of vulgarity and insincerity. More than this, he wants to steal Rick and Morty's narrative marketability and entertainment value to break through the fifth wall. They share a fierce battle in [[Never Ricking Morty]], before Rick gains the upper hand and traps Story Lord within his Story Train, alongside Jesus. If Story Lord survives, his grudge against Rick would presumably only be festering.

===[[Jesus Christ]]===
Although Jesus first appears as an enemy to Story Lord, after they are both trapped within the Story Train, the latter takes the time to diplomatize. They seem to have a somewhat considerate relationship before Jesus calls on his power to both their uncertain fates.

==Trivia==

*Rick refers to Story Lord as a "matrix, space-Frasier,' referencing his power to trap people within stories, like the titular simulation of the [[matrix:The_Matrix_franchise|Matrix Franchise]], and his appearance and smug attitude like that of the fictional Seattle radio host [https://frasier.fandom.com/wiki/Frasier_Crane Frasier Crane.]
