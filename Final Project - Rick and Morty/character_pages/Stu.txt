'''Stu''' was a [[Zigerion]] scammer working for [[Prince Nebulon]]. He was killed in an explosion caused by [[Rick Sanchez]]. 

==Biography==
He was on the team of scammers attempting to steal [[Rick]]'s recipe for [[concentrated dark matter]]. They captured Rick and put him in a simulation, inside of a simulation, inside of another simulation. Stu was the Zigerion who discovered [[Jerry Smith|Jerry's]] presence in the simulation and alerted [[Prince Nebulon]]. Like the rest of the Zigerions aboard the spacecraft, he was killed when the "formula" they believe they scammed from Rick caused a massive explosion and destroyed their entire ship.

==Personality==
While he only appeared in the episode briefly, Stu seemed more serious and professional than many of his colleagues. He didn't whine or joke about Rick and [[Morty Smith|Morty's]] nudity, instead remaining focused on his job.

Stu was also intelligent and efficient, being the first to realize a second human is in the simulation and quickly identifying him as Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith.

==Trivia==
*In the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], there was a picture of Stu on the wall of Rick's bedroom.
