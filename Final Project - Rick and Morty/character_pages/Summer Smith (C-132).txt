==Personality==
Summer is a strong-willed girl, having a strong belief in what's morally correct, even in spite of Rick's belief that nothing matters, she is also a standing strong and rebellious girl against any society she sees is corrupted. In the early comics she was very petty and focusing solely on her popularity at school. After endearing so much pain from Rick, along with her family, she has grown immensely. Her worries shifted, as she grows ever more jealous of Morty's relationship with Rick.
===Differences from in-show [[Summer Smith|counterpart]]===
The Summer Smith who live in the Dimension C-132 is much a kinder and more relaxed girl than the Summer that the cartoon. She is also a less petty and more agile girl, handling herself pretty well. Her future self appears as a twice, stern, strong and resilient girl. In the comic series, Summer is also depicted as having a close relationship with [[Mr. Poopybutthole]], that has yet to be explored in the series, but is very likely since he was such a close family friend to the Smith family.
