'''Summer Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)''' is an alternate version of the original [[Summer Smith|Summer]], that appeared in the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], she is the daughter of [[Jerry Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Jerry Smith]] and [[Beth Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Beth Smith]], the older sister of [[Morty Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Morty Smith]], the granddaughter of Leonard Smith, Joyce Smith, [[Rick Sanchez (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Rick Sanchez]] and Mrs. Sanchez, the great-granddaughter of Rick's Father and a unnamed woman, and the great-niece of the Unnamed Uncle.
==Biography==
In the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], Summer and her family were sitting around the table, eating breakfast, when all of a sudden, [[Evil Rick]] and [[Evil Morty]] opened a portal, walked into the room, and shot her grandfather [[Rick Sanchez (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Rick]] as well as tranquilizing her brother [[Morty Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Morty]] and taking the boy with them, leaving Summer, screaming at the top of her lungs, being completely terrified and having no idea what to do, along with her parents.
==Appearance==
Summer is a teenage-girl of average height and a thin build. She has a light skin-tone, and shoulder-length light brown hair. Her facial features take after Jerry's, having an oval head and pointed nose.

Her most common outfit has been a magenta tank-top, white capri-pants, and black slip-ons. She usually has her hair pulled back in a high ponytail.

==Personality==
Summer has some personality traits of a typical American teenager. She wishes to be popular among her peers, and finds the antics of her family to be dysfunctional; she genuinely cares about them, however. She's very attached to her phone and social media, taking videos of her dog Snuffles when he became super-smart, and shuddering at the thought of her father [[Jerry Smith (Evil Rick's Target Dimension)|Jerry]] joining Facebook.
