==History==
Seeing Rick and Morty at their home via satellite (complete with thermal imaging), an unhappy President calls them on their progress regarding the monster. Rick and Morty lie about their progress, but the President calls their bluff, and an argument erupts over the two's constant law breaking despite saving the world several times. 

When a miniature civilization is discovered in the Amazon rainforest, Rick and Morty travel to Brazil to investigate. At the same time, however, the U.S. Government arrives claiming jurisdiction. When Rick and Morty protest, the President has them arrested and shrinks down to negotiate with the civilization. Once he leaves, Rick and Morty break free of their restraints (made of the fake element "Sanchezium") and quickly escape from being surrounded by pirates, one of the few things Rick fears.

Upon arriving at the Megagargantuan civilization, the President is disappointed to learn that Rick and Morty have already negotiated a peace treaty with their Presidentress. Once back to his normal size, the President declares war on Rick and Morty, growing even more upset after learning that they had also negotiated a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine and gave him all the credit.

Following the ensuing press conference, The President asks for Rick and Morty's whereabouts, only to discover they have both been patiently waiting inside the Oval Office. Having fulfilled the President's agenda for him, Rick promises to leave for good on the condition that Morty gets a selfie with the President, regardless of his grandson's lack of interest. When the President continues to refuse the request, Rick indirectly kills most of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, culminating in a lengthy battle with the President throughout the White House.
