'''Teacher Rick''' is an alternate version of [[Rick Sanchez]] who first appeared in the episode, "[[Tales From the Citadel]]". He is a teacher at Morty Academy, where Rickless Mortys are being trained for a new Rick. As it appears, the Morty Academy was created for Morty's to be the best sidekicks and always be positive towards Ricks, it seems as if Morty's are trained with only one point of view allowed and they have to be on that view or else they will fail the class/not graduate from the Morty Academy. He has students called [[Left-Handed Morty]], [[Lizard Morty]], [[Slick Morty]], and [[Glasses Morty|Glasses Morty.]] He has one Rick called [[Slow Rick]], which he refers to as "Tall Morty".

==Appearance==
'''Teacher Rick''' shares the general appearance of Rick Sanchez, though he has long hair, a blue bowtie, brown shirt, white undershirt, grey pants, and a black robe with gold edging.
==Appearances==
===[[Season 3]]===
*"[[Tales From the Citadel]]"

==Trivia==
* His appearance is a reference to Severus Snape, a fictional character who is a teacher of magic in Harry Potter.
* He might be what became of [[Maximums Rickimus]] if he survived Rick C-137's bullet in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]".
