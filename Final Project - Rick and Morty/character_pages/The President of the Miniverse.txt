'''The President of the Miniverse''' is the unnamed president who is the head of the society in [[Zeep Zanflorp]]'s [[Miniverse]]. He appeared in the episode [[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]. Like [[Chris (The Ricks Must Be Crazy)|The President of the Microverse]] and the scientist Zeep, he is the only one who knows about a top secret project being worked on by the scientist [[Kyle]], wherein he is making his own miniature universe that will provide a universal source of energy for them, making the "Flooblecrank" that powers Zeep's universe obsolete.

He died, along with everyone else inside the Miniverse, as it was destroyed by [[Rick Sanchez]].
