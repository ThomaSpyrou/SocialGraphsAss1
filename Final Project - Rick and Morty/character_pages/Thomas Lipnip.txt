'''Thomas''' '''"Tommy" Lipnip''' is [[Beth Smith|Beth's]] childhood friend. He appeared in "[[The ABC's of Beth]]".
==Biography==
As a little girl, [[Beth Smith|Beth]] invited Tommy into [[Froopyland]] where she attempted to trap him due to being jealous of him and his loving [[Joseph Lipnip|father]].

During this time, Tommy entered into a bizarre and revolting cycle of cannibalistic incest to survive.

When Beth attempts to bring Tommy back in order to prove his father's innocence, who was convicted of murdering and eating him, she is forced to take matters into her own hands. She reveals her identity and tells him of his father's impending fate. Tommy was shocked to see her again but refused to return with her unless she apologized and admitted her fault (which she didn't want to like her father did earlier). At the end, Beth didn't apologize to him and realized she was like her father. Tommy then ordered the [[Froopyland|froopy creatures]] to kill her, and Beth and the creatures started a battle.

His current status is unknown, as Beth only returns to the real world with a finger so that [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] can make a [[Tommy's Clone|clone of him]], this means he is likely dead or at least partially injured.
