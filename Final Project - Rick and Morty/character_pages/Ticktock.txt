'''Ticktock''' is a child of [[Gaia]] and [[Reggie]].

==Biography==

After Gaia gave birth to Ticktock, he was raised through [[Rick Sanchez]] and [[Beth Smith]]'s sorting factory and was categorized as "unproductive", being dumped out into the mud. There, he met [[Jerry Smith]], who taught him and all the other unproductives about camping. Jerry passed Ticktock and told him to keep whittling.

Later, the unproductives waged war on the rest of Gaia and Reggie's children, led by Jerry. When Reggie was killed, his massive body fell from the sky and killed most of his children.
