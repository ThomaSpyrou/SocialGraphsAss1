The '''Tina-Teers''' are a group of four people from each major ethnicity:  Caucasian, Black, Italian, and Asian. In mid 1990's, when they were young adults, Mother Nature recruited them to combat pollution and entrusted them with four magic rings which grant the powers of fire, water, air, and dirt.

When the Tina-Teers combine their powers, they summon the environmental superheroine [[Planetina]].

By the time they were middle aged, they became more concerned with making money than saving the planet and began to see Planetina as a product, eventually planing to sell her to an Arab who likes to eat the meat of baby endangered animals.

[[Morty Smith]], who had fallen in love with Planetina, killed the Tina-Teers and stole their rings so that he and Planetina could be together.

==Trivia==
*They are a parody of the Planeteers, a group of five eco-warrior teenagers from cult 90â€™s television series ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers.'' All four are based on four of the five Planeteers; Wheeler, Linka, Kwame and Gi.
