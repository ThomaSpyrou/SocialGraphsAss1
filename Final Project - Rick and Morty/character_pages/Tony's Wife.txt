}}'''Tony's Wife''' is the unnamed deceased wife of [[Tony]]. Tony uses her death as an excuse for using [[Rick Sanchez|Rick's]] toilet, despite the fact that an alternate timeline's version of him (from a universe where his wife is still alive) also uses his toilet. She appeared in a holographic simulation, pooping in a toilet in Toilet Heaven.
