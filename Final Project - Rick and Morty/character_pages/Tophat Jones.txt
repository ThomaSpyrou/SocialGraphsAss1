'''Tophat Jones''' is a breakfast cereal mascot that appears in a commercial for [[Strawberry Smiggles]] in the episode "[[Rixty Minutes]]", and has since then made numerous appearances in ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]]'', along with the [[Strawberry Smiggles]] product itself. Jones is a parody of Lucky the Leprechaun, the mascot for Lucky Charms, and the Trix Rabbit, the mascot for Trix Cereal.

==Appearance==
Tophat Jones resembles an amalgamation of Lucky the Leprechaun and the Trix Rabbit: He wears traditional leprechaun attire, but has a pair of white rabbit ears and a top hat.

==Personality==
Tophat Jones' selfishness and greed led to the dismemberment of his flesh and organs. It can be assumed that he was not a very good person outside from what we have seen of him either since he immediately saw demons during his death.

==Appearances==
*"[[Rixty Minutes]]"
*"[[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]]"
*"[[The Wedding Squanchers]]"
