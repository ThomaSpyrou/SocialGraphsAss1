{{Quote|By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like "Scar", Stripe, or "Goliath". That's because, to me, you aren't special. You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should've impressed.
|Rick, before killing Tough Rat}}
'''Tough Rat''' is a character who appears inÂ [[Pickle Rick]]. When [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]] turns himself into a pickle and is flushed in sewer he is attacked by group of rats. Tough Rat is the strongest and the most distinctive rat. As such, Rick kills Tough Rat last. He states that Tough Rat was only special to the rats but means nothing to him so he won't give it any name, such as "Stripes" or "Scar."
