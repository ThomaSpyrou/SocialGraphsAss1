The '''Traflorkians''' are a species of small green aliens. They are often seen performing various jobs throughout the universe, and Rick Sanchez has befriended a lot of them.

==History==
According to the [[Galactic Federation]], Traflorkians came to [[Earth]] thousands of [[Glaagnar|glaagnars]] ago and planted bones and fossils all over the planet as a goof, meaning that dinosaurs never existed.

They were involved in a series of conflicts with the [[Pizarians]] called [[Pizarians#The Marinara Wars|the Marinara Wars]], where the Traflorkians' God Emperor '''Pahpahj’han''' consumed millions of Pizarians.<ref>[http://fedconnect.galacticfederation.com/post/155976542608/dear-humans-your-pizza-is-appropriating-our FedConnect - GFedToday: Dear Humans]</ref>

[[Rick Sanchez]] invited a great number of Traflorkians to his house party.

==Culture==
Traflorkians is a species known to goof around, particularly after they planted bones and fossils on a primitive Earth as a joke to lead humans into beliveing dinosaurs used to roam the planet.

===Glip-Glop===
"'''Glip-Glop'''" is a derogatory term for Traflorkians, described by Rick as "the N-word and the [[Wikipedia:Chink|C-word]] had a baby, and that baby was raised by all the [[wikipedia:List of ethnic slurs by ethnicity#Jews|bad words for jews]]." Rick is quoted saying, "WHAT UP MY GLIP-GLOPS!" when the Traflorkians arrive, further proving its parallels to the N-word.
