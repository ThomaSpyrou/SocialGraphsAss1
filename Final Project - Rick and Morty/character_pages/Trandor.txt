==Biography==
Trandor used to be in a relationship with the warrior princess Kiara before he ended it. And while he returned to hunting Varrix on [[Earth]] (his domain), Kiara did not take the breakup lightly and sought to make him jealous by engaging in a new relationship on Earth where Trandor would notice.

[[Jerry]], being the coward that he is, blamed his children [[Morty]] and [[Summer]] for his breakup with Kiara. This led her to chase them all into a cave with a small colony of Varrix. After Jerry owned up the reason behind their breakup, Kiara started on a rant on humanity before Trandor noticed them in the same cave. At once Trandor knew why Kiara had appeared on Earth and did not seem to want to take her back. Later, Trandor found the texts between Kiara and Jerry and went to kill him but Rick killed him before he could find Jerry.

==Appearance==
Trandor is a tall, blue scaled, somewhat fish-like alien with a broad build. His forehead has two horizontal white stripes running across and his chin two vertical lines, his ears appear flap-like with a large circular hole and the hair-area on his head is slightly more green in color. Several spikes can be spotted on his head. He is broad shouldered with three pecs as well as three fingers on each hand.

He appears with a shoulder guard on his left shoulder held on by a red strap across his chest; he wears a similar strap on his right arm, but with the colors reversed and expanded. On each forearm he wears a brown armor. On his stomach he wears a red belt crested with, presumably, a blue jewel in the middle. His groin is only covered by a short red loin cloth hanging from his belt.
