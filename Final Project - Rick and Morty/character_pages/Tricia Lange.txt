She is a recurring character in ''[[Rick and Morty (TV series)|Rick and Morty]]''. She is friends with [[Jessica]] and [[Jessica's Friend (2)|Jessica’s Friend]]. She also went on a date with [[Ethan]]. She first appeared in the [[Season 3]] episode, "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]".



==Biography==
The original Tricia Lange presumably became a Cronenberg in Dimension C-137.

[[Ethan]] cancelled a camping trip with his girlfriend [[Summer Smith]] to instead spend the night with Tricia, a move that both Summer and her brother, [[Morty Smith]], chose to attribute to her unusually huge breasts. This caused Summer to become insecure about her own breast size. When the Smith family interrupted their camping trip, Tricia was emotionally touched by seeing Beth comfort Summer, despite their larger size and strange inside-out appearance. She quickly left Ethan to call her mother.

She is also friends with [[Jessica]] and talked with her about her breakup with [[Brad]], expressing her desire for warm "penis-in-foreskin" love, which hints that she may have a foreskin fetish. She later exhibits similar interest in urination. In spite of her initial rivalry, Trisha is showing to be friends with Summer. She is also shown to friends with Nancy though doesn’t hesitate to criticize her but has offered to change her appearance.

In [[Rattlestar Ricklactica]], while the snakes were attempting to take over Earth, Tricia was in Summer's room criticizing [[Nancy|Nancy's]] clothing choice and weight while dancing with Summer the rhythm of the snake jazz.

In ''[[Promortyus]],'' she mentions a sexual interest in [[Jerry Smith]], bluntly telling Summer that she wanted to sleep with her father, to the latter’s obvious disgust.

==Appearance==
Tricia has long brown hair, a narrow nose, and a notably huge chest, which she is most known for. She wears a low-cut white crop top, a burgundy skirt, white nylons and a cross necklace.

==Personality==
Tricia only appears briefly in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]," but she seems to be a sensitive girl, crying tears at seeing Beth comfort her daughter Summer despite their appearance and left Ethan to go call her mother. She also seems to be religious, as she is seen wearing a cross necklace.

Ironically, despite this, she is evidently a sexual deviant, and appears to be into urophilia, (sexual arousal from being urinated on), as she mentions enjoying it at the end of "[[Rest and Ricklaxation]]". She also didn’t hesitate to tell Summer that she wanted to sleep with her father after taking note of him beekeeping. Tricia seems to be willing to be friends with nearly anyone as long as they have popularity or good looks.
