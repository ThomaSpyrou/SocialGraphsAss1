Rick mentions to never looking its eyes because you'll know everything.

The tortoise then says "Daed si luap, eltaeb a mi" which is backwards for "im a beatle, paul is deaD" which is a reference to [[wikipedia:Paul is dead|a conspiracy theory]] that claimed that Paul McCartney from The Beatles died during 1966-67 and was replaced by a look-alike. [[Justin Roiland]] actually did the voice for this part.
