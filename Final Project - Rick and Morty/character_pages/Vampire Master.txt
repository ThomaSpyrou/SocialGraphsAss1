==Biography==
In the post-ending credits epilogue of the episode [[Big Trouble In Little Sanchez]], a dark and haunted castle was seen, where all of the world's vampires gathered together. The supreme overlord of all the vampires emerged from the dead and his servant told him the news about [[Coach Feratu|Coach Feratu's]] cover being blown and getting killed earlier on. He started to talk about the situation, before he stopped, in shock over how his name was nothing but a lame pun. He continued to criticize how stupid it is that all of the vampires have names that are puns on famous vampire names and ordered that they would no longer be doing that and instead take generic names. He then proceeded to suck the blood out of a woman's neck and kill her.
