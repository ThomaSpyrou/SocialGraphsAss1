'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a parasitic alien which once possessed [[Morty Smith]]. It appeared in the episode "[[Morty's Mind Blowers]]".

==Appearance==
Voltamatron is almost as wide as Morty's torso, and probably as long as Morty is tall. Its skin appears green and slimy, and the body is worm-like with a large mouth at the end and no visible eyes.

==Biography==
Voltamatron, somehow, entered Morty's body at some point prior to the episode "Morty's Mind Blowers". Presumably in order to destroy [[Earth]], it possessed Morty in front of the latter's family and showcased its cosmic powers by levitating objects around him. Rick knew the only way to overpower Voltamatron was to show Morty love and urged the Smiths to do so. Telling Morty they love him, Voltamatron was slowly forced out of Morty; however, the Smiths quickly lost their concentration and started complaining about Morty instead. This allowed Voltamatron to start re-entering Morty, causing him great pain. This incident was later removed from Morty's memory and placed in Rick's memory chamber.
