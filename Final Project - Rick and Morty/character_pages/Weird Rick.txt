'''{{PAGENAME}}''', is an antagonist and the Rick responsible for the deaths of [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]] and Beth Sanchez in [[Dimension C-137]]<ref>[[Rickmurai Jack]]</ref>. Weird Rick's actions were the catalyst for [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] rising to power as the "Rickest Rick". Despite Rick C-137 attempting to enact revenge on Weird Rick for decades, he ultimately failed and Weird Rick's status is currently unknown.

== Appearance ==
Weird Rick has more grayish skin than other versions of Ricks, as well as more dull-colored hair. He wore a purplish jacket with a gray shoulder pad and a red shirt underneath. He also wore grayish black pants and appears to have been using the "iPhone 3 equivalent" prototype of the modern [[Portal Gun]] upon first meeting Rick C-137.

== History ==

=== ''Rick and Morty'' ===
Weird Rick first approached Rick C-137 to introduce him to interdimensional travel and the existence of the [[multiverse]] only for C-137 to deny any interest. Insulted, Weird Rick left and it is assumed he sent a bomb to [[Dimension C-137]], presumably to kill his counterpart out of spite, but instead killed [[Beth Sanchez (C-137)|Beth]] and [[Diane Sanchez]] who were now standing in his place. After seeking medical attention and grieving for some time, Rick C-137 developed the [[Portal Technology|technology]] required for a functional portal gun on his own and began searching the multiverse for Weird Rick to avenge his family. After years of futile hunting however, he eventually gave up and aided in brokering a peace treaty between [[Rick (disambiguation)|Ricks]]. This decision consequently led to formation of the [[The Citadel]], and Rick C-137 resigning himself to simply moving in with an alternate version of Beth instead. Weird Rick is presumed to be still alive.

When Rick C-137 was captured and interrogated on the origins of the Portal Gun formula by [[Cornvelious Daniel]] in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]", he revealed a slightly edited version of Weird Rick's visit in order to allow him to take control of the situation and jumpstart his escape attempt.

In "[[Rickmurai Jack]]", Rick reveals his past to [[Morty Smith|Morty]] and his failed vendetta against Weird Rick. This revelation leads Morty to claim he feels "... a lot better having seen all that" and seems relieved. This may be likely to aid in laying the groundwork for their mutual trust going forward.

=== Pocket Mortys ===
In ''[[Pocket Mortys]]'', Weird Rick, whose name is given here, is a customization option at Salesman Rick's, and can be purchased for 10 Blips and Chitz coupons (or 10 credits if the player is playing in Multiplayer).
