'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as '''Cowboy Morty''', is a cowboy version of Morty who travels with [[Western Rick|his Rick]] on adventures and to [[The Citadel]].

==Appearance==
{{PAGENAME}}, as he is a cowboy variation of [[Morty]], looks very similar to Morty, aside from a few differences. He wears a red bandanna around his neck, a cowboy vest, a belt with an oversized buckle and a brown cowboy hat.

==Biography==
This Morty was born and raised in a cowboy dimension with his family and Rick. He often joined his Rick on visits to [[The Citadel]], one of which [[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind|coincided with the trial]] of [[Rick C-137]]. [[Morty]] took notice of his cowboy counterpart passing by, but his Rick dismissed it, saying Morty was easily impressed.

He appeared in a leaflet for [[Mortyism]] where he was sitting in the waiting room at a Morty hospital (St. Mortimers Hospital) and talking to other Mortys. While doing homework, his Rick had portaled him into a battle arena to fight a monster and had his left arm ripped off. He was then taught by Nurse Morty that Rick will leave him alone if he's busy masturbating. He quickly acted on this advice once his arm was reattached, only to return to the hospital later, but this time because of skin burns on his penis.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/unidlehands_/ Unidle Hands - Rickstaverse]</ref>

He also appeared in another leaflet where he had built a soapbox race car for the annual Morty Carlo Rally. Though it's not known shown how he placed in the race.
