'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as '''Cowboy Rick''', is an alternate version of [[Rick]] who, along with [[Western Morty|his Morty]], hails from a cowboy dimension.

==Appearance==
{{PAGENAME}}, as he is a variation of [[Rick]], looks very similar to Rick, aside from a few differences. Unlike Rick, {{PAGENAME}} wears a green bolo tie, a large belt buckle on his belt, boots with spurs, and a white cowboy hat.

==Biography==
{{PAGENAME}} was on a visit to [[The Citadel]] with his Morty at the same time as Rick and [[Morty]] of [[Dimension C-137]] was brought in to be judged by the [[Council of Ricks]]. They later came to the trial and kept in the far back.

He portaled his Morty, without warning, into a battle arena where his Morty fought against a giant spider and had his arm ripped off. He later walked in on Morty masturbating and left in disgust without forcing him on another adventure.

He survived the events of the [[Galactic Federation#Fall|fall of the Galactic Federation]] and temporary destruction of The Citadel by either fighting, hiding or not being present at The Citadel at the time. 

During the presidential debate, {{PAGENAME}} was backstage with [[Salesman Rick]] and was arguing with [[Black Rick]] about something. most likely related to the upcoming election.
