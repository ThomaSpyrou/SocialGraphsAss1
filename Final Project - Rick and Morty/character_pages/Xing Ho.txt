== Biography ==
The original Xing Ho presumably became a Cronenberg in the [[Cronenberged dimension]].

Xing Ho is the Tina-Teer for dirt and has possession of the dirt ring. The dirt ring summons dirt when the word "dirt" is said and stone when the word "stone" is said. When [[Planetina]] was summoned with [[Morty Smith|Morty]] to Eco-Con, she expressed concern for controversy and let [[Eddie]] deal with Morty. Morty later burned Eddie and invaded the meeting room with the Tina-Teers and the Arab ambassador. After the air Tina-Teer is killed by the security guards' crossfire, Morty takes her ring and shoves it in Xing Ho's mouth. He shouts "airs" blowing her head up like a balloon before it pops and kills her.

== Trivia ==

* She is based on Gi; Asia born girl who wields the power ring of water.
** The difference to Xing Ho and Gi is Xing Ho controls dirt. Taking earth powers from Planeteer Kwame.
