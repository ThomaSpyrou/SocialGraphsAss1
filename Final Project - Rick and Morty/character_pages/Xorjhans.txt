'''Xorjhan''' is a species of purple humanoid aliens, some of which moved to [[Earth]] after it became part of the [[Galactic Federation]]. 

One Xorjhan enrolled in [[Harry Herpson High School]] prior to the [[Blemflarck#Blemflarck Crisis|Blemflarck Crisis]] and the [[Galactic Federation#Fall|Fall of the Galactic Federation]], and whipped a towel through another student's body during a game of towel snapping in the boys' locker room. 

==Appearance==
Xorjhans appear to be completely hairless, purple beings. About as tall as a regular human, they do not possess toes, nipples or a nose. They also have pink rashes on their bodies, though this may be equal to pimples on teenage humans. Their strength is shown to be far above that of humans, not unlike many other aliens.

==Trivia==
*Their name was given in the same Instagram-post on Rickstaverse as their only appearance.
