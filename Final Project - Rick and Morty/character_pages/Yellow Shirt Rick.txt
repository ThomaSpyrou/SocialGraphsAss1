'''Yellow Shirt Rick''' is a Rick that wears a yellow shirt instead of the blue shirt commonly worn by Ricks. He is paired with [[Blue Shirt Morty]]; both of whom are similar to the originals from [[Dimension C-137]], only the colors of their shirts are swapped.

==Biography==
He first appears in the episode [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]], where he is standing around with his Morty and talking with a [[Guard Rick]]. The captured [[Rick]] and [[Morty]] of Dimension C-137 are escorted past them on their way to the [[Council of Ricks]]. He was not present at the trial.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind (Game)]], this Rick is featured on the card "Color Swap Rick".
**The image used on the card is actually of another Rick and Morty couple who had wore the regular shirts in the episode, but had their shirt colors swapped for the card
*He is seen in the season 2 intro, where he and other Rick's were fixing something. Yellow shirt Rick decided to touch some machine, but ended up getting killed by it.
*Yellow Shirt Rick briefly appeared in Rick's memories in [[Rickmurai Jack]] where he is shown being shot, due to this death and the death shown in the season 2 intro, it is possible there are multiple Yellow Shirt Ricks or a singular Yellow Shirt Rick has access to his own Operation Phoenix.
