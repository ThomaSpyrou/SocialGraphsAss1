'''Zerillians''' are large, 3-eyed, humanoid beings with warty skin. 

==Appearance==
Zerillians vary on height and skin color; a prisoner was tall and pink, while an office worker was short and brown. They all have large warts all over their body, three eyes and unibrow. 

==History==
Rick was assigned a space in galactic prison next to a Zerillian who asked him what he was in for, Rick then responded with "everything". This Zerillian later broke out after [[The Citadel]] was transported into the prison.

Another Zerillian worked in the same office as [[Jerry Smith]] before the [[Blemflarck#Blemflarck Crisis|Blemflarck Crisis]] hit. He was killed in front of Jerry during the ensuing riot.

==Trivia==
*The Zerillian in "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]" was voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].
