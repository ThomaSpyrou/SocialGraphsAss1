==Biography==
In ''"[[Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind]]"'', Zeta Alpha Rick appears alongside his fellow council-members, [[Rick Prime]], [[Maximums Rickimus]], [[Quantum Rick]], [[Riq IV]], and [[Ricktiminus Sancheziminius]], accusing [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] for the murder of 27 alternate Ricks, including [[The Scientist Formerly Known as Rick]]. He joined them in sentencing Rick C-137 to the machine of unspeakable doom, to which he steals a portal gun and escapes from the Citadel.

After the real perpetrator, [[Evil Rick]], was beaten to death by the group of enslaved Mortys, the Council of Ricks shows up to escort the Rick-less Mortys back to their respective dimensions. The Council takes C-137 Rick and Morty back to the Citadel, and officially apologize to Rick for accusing him of the murders. They even offer him a coupon for a free Morty, should anything ever happen to his, which Rick accepts while Morty's back is turned.

In ''"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]"'', the Council of Ricks hold [[Morty]] and [[Summer]] captive after sending [[SEAL Team Ricks]] to assassinate Rick C-137. After Rick teleported the entire Citadel back into the middle of the Federation prison, a heated battle broke out between the two sides. Rick infiltrated the Council chamber and kills most of the Council of Ricks, killing Zeta Alpha Rick with a shot to the head before ending up in a standoff with Riq IV, ultimately killing him and wiping out the council.
