 I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? What? Damn it! Beth! Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? What? For real? Knock, knock. My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?" Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. Well, yeah, on horses. Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home. I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Well, maybe you're right. Ahem, Horse heart surgeon. Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche. I'm an angry father, not an improviser. You're beyond our reasoning! Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas. It's personal. Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. Holy crap. He's right. But— No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school. Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you. What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? Outside? Are you kidding me?! Come on! Your idiot dog! Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you? Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded! Holy crap! Now bring me my slippers. This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog. You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what? Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna". I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing? Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there? Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over. Why not? Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding. Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut? I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them. I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller. Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape. Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought... I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. My marriage is fine, thank you. Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom. Beth, do you still love me? The "yes" or "no" kind. Yess. Noo. Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people? Sort of. This late? She's gonna be alone with that guy all night. ...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed. This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket. Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid. Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars? I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving. This is Rum Raisin! Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or-- I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it. It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon. Well don't different animals- Oh God... Yes Beth. Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in. She normally works on horses. Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends. We did it... Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it. Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married. One last stop. There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute. I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that. Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery. Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right? Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying. Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk? The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk. She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey! Ok… I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself. Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything! Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it? Yeah. She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become. We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night. You… would? Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t. We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life! Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts. I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW! Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all. Where am I? My goodness. I see-WAIT! What? Yeah, but, I mean- Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes! Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch! Got it. Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife. Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make. Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it. Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes. Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first. Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT. Beth, can we talk about this privately? But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?! Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is -- You got it. I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do. Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules. You spoil us, Conroy. Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning. Ooh! The galactic government collapsed. Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose? Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time. Beth, it's him or me! Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets? Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash. I, you know what, I- My goofy brother Steve. He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind? But I've known him my whole life! I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did. Nicky!  Well, of course it happened. You know they won't come here anymore.  Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend. Sleepy Gary, a word? Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then... Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real? Sure. Why not? I'd like that. What are we doing? Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house. You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary. No. No! Send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary. Look out for that homeless guy! There isn't time! Just run! They say you shouldn't do that! Just run!  I'm a parasite! Me, too. This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family. I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend. Morty, who’s at the door? Just like his old man. Should be making us a whole restaurant. Hey! What the heck? Wait, no! -give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection, just don’t hurt me!  Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons. You hate me for buying those coins! Uh, hello? Rick! Heyy. Haha, what’s- what’s up? What? Rick, no! Mortyyyy! Ugh. Leave me alone, I’m working! Ugh. I’m- I’m in between advertising jobs. W-well, it’s a little more complicated than that…  Dude, are you… wh- you’re being a dick, right? You’re really a Rick? Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ‘Mask.’ You know, the one with Cher in it? According to who? Other versions of you? If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself. The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all. It’s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order! Hey, uh. C’mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something. Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but… you’re a genius scientist, what do you think? There’s little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!  How long are you staying?  I found mine. I found mine. W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe… you know… get rid of him? I’m not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I’m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but- Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors. Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?  Wow! If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. Summer, what did I just- Beth! You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple." Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Nailed it. Yeah, yeah. I got it. Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down? You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck. Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?! Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me! You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!  Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. You're kidding me. I'm sorry. Hours? Everybody shut up! Let me try!  Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Wait. What? Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner. Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. Where would you go? Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? I think we'll take our food to go. Fair enough. So... You still thinking about taking that trip? Was I one of those guys? Well... I got you pregnant. No. No more boxes. Oh, my God! No, no..! Yes! Because he loves her? Okay, I've got an idea, Rick: you show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that. Hey! Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme? So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn? The pleasure's all mine. Wait! No, the other thing! Go back!  Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman? You speak da tru-tru. I'm in "Cloud Atlas"! What's "Cloud Atlas"? Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru. You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee--  Give me those!  Whiteness... Pure whiteness. Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp! That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon. Ahh, uh-- Summer's turn!  It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?  Come on! Time's up!  I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie.  You get the idea. I work with lions. Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night. Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables! All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?" Well now you know: you'd be a doctor.  Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht--  banging Kristen Stewart! Yeah, you're welcome. That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting. What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not. Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic. Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it. Or? Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty. And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy. Uh, I thought it was cool. Wait, this is an actual movie? Well, somebody in Hollywood just lost their job. I wrote and directed that? What am I, nuts? Hey, if your, uh, mother and I had to split custody - who would you guys choose?  Oh... Don't even think about it.  It's my life, and we're watching it. Where the hell am I going? Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school. I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart. I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I've never stopped thinking about what might've been. Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside? Ooh! Family vacation! Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this. *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax. Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music* National Apple Farmers of America… Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.  Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry.  With that, I give you your new slogan!  Well, say something! Do you like it? You do? So I sold it? I sold the idea? Oh my god! Thank you! Hey! I just sold my first pitch! Guess who just sold the apples campaign. Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someone was wrong. Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife. Wait, really? Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife! *kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm! Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?! Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud. Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk? Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. "Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?" It's almost identical. Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk. *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in "Hungry for Apples" that's shared by "Got milk?" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted! Yeah! Wait. Really? Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time. I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something. Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns? Could we nominate me? Holy crap! I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that. Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete! Aah! What the hell?!  No. *sobbing* No! What the…? You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us. Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there? So… What do you think? Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.  Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic.  Wait... What?  Not one thing out of place. Not a single thing. A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?  Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow! Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio.  This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone. So... You're a Titanic fanatic? Happy to help... rose. Oh, Rose. Is that what I think it is? I can't wait to do that with Beth.  Look!  No! What happened?!  Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken. But -- but -- I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure.  Get it?  Ooh!  Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind. Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh. Aah!  Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.  Beth! What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips?   Ugh! I'm not going to fit.  Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and -- It's not a door, Beth. It's debris. Yeah. Okay.  Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing. Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days. Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science. Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age. You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-  Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade. Morty, nobody changed the planets. Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree. That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball. Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto? Oh.  Okay good. This is gonna be fun! What are you guys talking about? You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you? Shut up, Rick. I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet. I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first!  I think I know what the A in NASA stands for. Ain’t no game, sucka. Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty! What the hell? I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction. Oh. I… Pluto… is a planet. Pluto is a planet. Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project. Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong? I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son. Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate. What’s up, Pluto? My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto. Morty, what? ...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage? I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them? I’m flattered, and humbled. What? Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son? It’s a what? Pluto is…  Not a planet. Ow! It’s not a planet! Hey! It’s not a planet! I’m an idiot, and I love my son! Hey! Hey Morty. Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again. Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system? But- Oh. I uh- I think I underst- I get it! Say no more. I got it! Noted! Goodnight!  Last King Christmas last arrived!  In the Christmas Christmas!  Mmm... Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham. Um, Merry Christmas?  Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? Good one. You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity. Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now. Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!  Yeah, it is... I don't get it. Huh. You think you know a guy.  Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday.  Hey hey! Oh, hi. Can I help you?  I wish... But thank you.  So... you're a...friend of the family...? Wow! ...Cool... Eggnog? Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is? Dad, please, what are you saying? Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover. I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad.  Summer, do you have a boyfriend? Um... No! Stop! I hate this! Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame. Ah, Rick?  I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you.  Right now, you’re my sanest relative. Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.  It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about. Sure, sweetie.  Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax. Yeah.  I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob. Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space? What are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s learning to drive.  Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure! Thank you! I’m Jerry.  I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming? What? What the hell? I know, right? Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.  Unbelievable.   I know how to crawl in a tube.  Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks…  Whoooooaaaa! You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized? Oh, come on, this is ridiculous! Aw… Beth… The factory tint setting is always too high!  Here comes another funny… I almost wish I could stay longer than one day. W-What do you mean? Uuuum…  I can’t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw. You know what?  Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys.  I say we escape. But… If you can leave, then why are you still here? I’m leaving. Um… Earth, please? Um… Is this… Do I pay? Sorry! Hmm. Hmm…  Agh!  I don’t… What do you want? Oh!  Ahahaaaahhhhh….  Uhhh… Huhhh….  Oooh!   Right? Who needs that? Uh… Who are you? …Geez… Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input? Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick. I’d like that. I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ‘cause our weeds are wack, yo. I can't? What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house? Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! He's playing you, shorty. Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up. What the hell was that? That is a hatch! Your father put a hatch in my garage! Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there. Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing? You're spinning this to his credit? I'm going down there. Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed? Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill. Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal- Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone! Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic! Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He's probably harvesting this creature's organs! He's going to eat it! No! You're the worst! You don't support this family! All you care about is yourself! You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos... ...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen! Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him! And why? Because you're the child, Beth. You, not me, you! Aaah! All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids. Bye, sweetie. Sure. Sounds important. If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh-- What? Hello? Summer. Thanks. I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right? Cool. Is that what they are? Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check? Come again? Beth, do you hear this? Yes, is that so hard to believe? Rick? But why does he always want to be hunted? Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit. Why was he in that cryopod? Well, I don't see any stakes at all. Guess we'll just be saying "ciao bella" to our deposit, then! Ahhh! No! A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!  Oooh, there's a handsome fellow! Sorry, what's happening? I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us– Why are we wearing these?  Oh, god!  Rick! I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.
