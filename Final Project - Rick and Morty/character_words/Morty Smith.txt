 What, Rick? What’s going on? It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard! Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise? What?! A bomb?! T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Jessica? From my math class? Ohh... Whhhh-wha? No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity! What are you talking about, Rick? I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou— That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world! Oh, thank god. It was? Um... I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. Jessica. Jessica. Whoa! Hi, Jessica. Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you! Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. Rename them? Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. Ah, Jessica. Jessica. Je-Jessica. Jessica. Uh, morning, Frank. Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank? I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? Oh, geez, okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. The mega trees? All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! I'm in a lot of pain, Rick! Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh! Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. Sure thing, Rick. Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. What?! Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? Uh-oh. In my butt? Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. Uuuh. In my butt? Oh, man. Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. Aaaaaah! Ohhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Aaaaah! Whoooooo! Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody. They're not robots, Rick! Holy crap! This is insane! Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding. Yeah. Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. I do? Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. 1.77245385... Whoa! "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart! Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. Aw, man. Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh. What's wrong? Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy. Aw, man! Snuffles. That was fantastic, Rick! W-w-w-what is it? You talking about "Inception"? "Inception" made sense. Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird. Ooohhh! What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava! Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird. Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. Ooh, oh! Oh, man. I'm sorry. No, no. No, thanks! No, I'm okay. Whoa! Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! It's Summer! Aw, geez. What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! Huh? Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good. Ohhhh! We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math? Ooooooaaahhh! Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot! But that's the opposite of what- Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick. Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking. Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry. Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool. You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. What the hell? Oh, man, what's going on? - Dad! - Rick! Th-thanks, snuffles. Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead! What? But I-it's been like a whole year! Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? What?! I'm gonna miss you, snowball. Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick. You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick. Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh. Ugghh Ummm Well, I mean, I was thinking about it. You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica! Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that. Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something? YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once? Oh well, okay... Oww! Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right? Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie! WOW, thanks! Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! Oh, well, no problem Brad. Whoa, take it easy! Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about? I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months! It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day! What? What kind of monster are you? Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean? Wait a minute, what? Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson? W-We just missed you a lot. Oh! Phew... Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under- Nuh uh! Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man. You shut up you big... female asshole! You didn't what? What's yours? You shut up! Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it. Why are you doing this? Yes, oh, yes, yes! Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right. Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance. I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything. But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think. Doesn't feel so good, does it? Uhh, where? Hey. Rick, are you really a musician? Me! B-b-but we don’t have a song! Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here! Oh man, ok, all right, um… Like we’re not already under enough pressure! Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song! Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose? What?! Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up! Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick! What?! That’s it! You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down! I’m going to go find Mom and Dad. Ahhh, shit. Birdperson? But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house? All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed? Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does. What’s that? Who’s that baby? Oh God! We’re up?!?! Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President! Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty! Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk? Uhhh, I’m not sure? Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck! What do you say, Rick? Ohhhh yeahhhh! Ohhhh yeahhhh! Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you? Understood. Woahh! Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know? Okay. Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there! Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent? Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this? Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here. Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen. I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy. Huh? What are you -- What are you doing? Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad. Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now. He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer! Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa! Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg. And how are you gonna do that? Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um- That's my sister. This used to be my home. These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so." So, uh-- What are you doing with that?! No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137. Summer. It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself. How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty. What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god. Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you! Rick! R-Rick? That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick! I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun! Who's stupid now, bitch?! Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note. So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways? Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet? Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my -- Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark. Oh, geez. Oh, fuck. Oh, man. Oh, man. You're gonna deny it. Oh. What are you talking about? Szechuan? McNuggets? What the hell? What are you talking about, Rick? What are you talking about?! What is that?! What are you talking about?! Rick? Rick? Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? Rick? W-where are you? Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something. And? Was it? Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? Well, can you move? Can you fly? All right, well, do pickles live forever or -- I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this. Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? He turned himself into a pickle. Oh, my God! I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. I, I liked her. Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die! Who? Who was that, Rick? Then why aren't we killing them?! Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators! Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded! I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep. Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo! Rick! Rick, stop! Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier! Happy hour. Whoa, yeah! Did he say "three for three"? You mean "two for two", right, Vance? So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us? We weren't here "last time", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde... This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts". I... think the personality conflict might have been... you. Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor? Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us. Yeah, but not heroes. I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine! Oh, God. I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry. I-I-I... I'm not a superhero. Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs. Get it yourself. Just focus on the mission, all right? Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now! Rick, is-is this a "Saw" thing? Are you seriously "Saw"-ing the Vindicators? Vance, stay calm... Okay, ouch, but... Guys!  I've figured it out. It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point. The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself! That's not the issue, Rick! Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? W-Wait, huh? Oh, o-okay. This again? I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk. In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out! You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back. Too many, Rick! Too many! You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe? Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood... Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction. Holy shit. You're jealous. Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right! I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave. What? I'll cover that bet. I get it. ...Motherfucker! Shut up. Greater good?! Never said that! No doubt. Who do we make the check out to? Right? Rick, Supernova's getting away! But.. she was trying to kill us! Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators. Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick! They tried to murder him first. Yeah, he knows. He murdered them. Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like. Man. Glad I’m not one of them! Mortys are human! WHOA!! That was amazing! I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place? Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit! Thanks Uncle Steve! What the hell, Rick? What the hell? Steve wasn't real? But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike. Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that. Come on, cousin Nicky. Youheard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things. What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick. I don't want to go to the dance alone. We shall. Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases. Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors. You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend. Oh -- oh, yeah? I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you! Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me? Everybody remain calm! This isgonna take some explaining. I didn't! She's real. She's my bitch of a sister. I-I-I thought you went to a concert! I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me! I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace! Keep breathing! Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep! Haha, yeah, cool. H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still. Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like— Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey. Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing. You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him— Rick! Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick. Do you have a rum and coke? Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart. That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life? Well-well, what about me? I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase. Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time. And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad? This may be the last time you lay eyes on me! R-rick? See, um th-the thing is, uh— Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little. Let’s just hit the reset button. I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together. Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care. Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel. Dumb. There’s a Morty president now. They made it Glendale. Even pooping hurts now. Th-th-that sounds really violent. Oh, Okay. Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow! I-I-I think I feel like myself again. Hey, they shot me! Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs. Woah! S-seriously? Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president. Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were. I don’t know. Tastes pretty good. Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice. We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like— Wait, what? Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P? I wanna know what he’s talking about. We kicked his ass. You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick. What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true! Liar! I’m not busy! Yeah. Holy shit! Wh-who’s that? Does he like it? What’s happening, Rick? What do you think he needed from your brain? What is the Central Finite Curve? So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything? It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything. No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you. Woah. Dead wife? Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that. Well what are you doin’ about it? Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you? Oh my fucking god! Woah! Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it. Rick! Oh, man. Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves? I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers. You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick? Um… because… our personalities are so different? Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over. Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices? Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building! You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object! You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield! I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster. W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid. Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh? Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there? Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass. Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little? It would go without saying, huh? Nah…  The Mortyest Morty… Oh yeah, how’s that? Uhh, where? Hey. Rick, are you really a musician? Me! B-b-but we don’t have a song! Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here! Oh man, ok, all right, um… Like we’re not already under enough pressure!  Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song! Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose? What?! Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up! Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick! What?! That’s it! You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down! I’m going to go find Mom and Dad. Ahhh, shit. Birdperson? But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house? All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed? Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does. What’s that? Who’s that baby? Oh God! We’re up?!?! Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President! Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty! Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk? Uhhh, I’m not sure? Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck! What do you say, Rick? Ohhhh yeahhhh! Ohhhh yeahhhh! Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you? Understood.
