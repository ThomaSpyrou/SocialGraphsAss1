 What, Rick? What’s going on? It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard! Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise? What?! A bomb?! T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Jessica? From my math class? Ohh... Whhhh-wha? No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity! What are you talking about, Rick? I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou— That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world! Oh, thank god. It was? Um... I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. Jessica. Jessica. Whoa! Hi, Jessica. Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you! Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. Rename them? Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. Ah, Jessica. Jessica. Je-Jessica. Jessica. Uh, morning, Frank. Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank? I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? Oh, geez, okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. The mega trees? All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! I'm in a lot of pain, Rick! Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh! Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. Sure thing, Rick. Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. What?! Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? Uh-oh. In my butt? Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. Uuuh. In my butt? Oh, man. Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. Aaaaaah! Ohhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Aaaaah! Whoooooo! Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody. They're not robots, Rick! Holy crap! This is insane! Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding. Yeah. Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. I do? Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. 1.77245385... Whoa! "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart! Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. Aw, man. Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh. What's wrong? Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy. Aw, man! Snuffles. That was fantastic, Rick! W-w-w-what is it? You talking about "Inception"? "Inception" made sense. Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird. Ooohhh! What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava! Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird. Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. Ooh, oh! Oh, man. I'm sorry. No, no. No, thanks! No, I'm okay. Whoa! Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! It's Summer! Aw, geez. What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! Huh? Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good. Ohhhh! We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math? Ooooooaaahhh! Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot! But that's the opposite of what- Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick. Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking. Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry. Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool. You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. What the hell? Oh, man, what's going on? - Dad! - Rick! Th-thanks, snuffles. Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead! What? But I-it's been like a whole year! Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? What?! I'm gonna miss you, snowball. Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick. You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick. Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh. Ugghh Ummm Well, I mean, I was thinking about it. You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica! Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that. Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something? YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once? Oh well, okay... Oww! Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right? Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie! WOW, thanks! Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! Oh, well, no problem Brad. Whoa, take it easy! Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about? I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months! It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day! What? What kind of monster are you? Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean? Wait a minute, what? Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson? W-We just missed you a lot. Oh! Phew... Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under- Nuh uh! Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man. You shut up you big... female asshole! You didn't what? What's yours? You shut up! Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it. Why are you doing this? Yes, oh, yes, yes! Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right. Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance. I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything. But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think. Doesn't feel so good, does it? Uhh, where? Hey. Rick, are you really a musician? Me! B-b-but we don’t have a song! Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here! Oh man, ok, all right, um… Like we’re not already under enough pressure! Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song! Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose? What?! Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up! Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick! What?! That’s it! You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down! I’m going to go find Mom and Dad. Ahhh, shit. Birdperson? But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house? All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed? Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does. What’s that? Who’s that baby? Oh God! We’re up?!?! Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President! Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty! Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk? Uhhh, I’m not sure? Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck! What do you say, Rick? Ohhhh yeahhhh! Ohhhh yeahhhh! Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you? Understood. Woahh! Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know? Okay. Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there! Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent? Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this? Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here. Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen. I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy. Huh? What are you -- What are you doing? Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad. Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now. He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer! Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa! Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg. And how are you gonna do that? Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um- That's my sister. This used to be my home. These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so." So, uh-- What are you doing with that?! No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137. Summer. It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself. How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty. What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god. Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you! Rick! R-Rick? That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick! I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun! Who's stupid now, bitch?! Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note. So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways? Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet? Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my -- Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark. Oh, geez. Oh, fuck. Oh, man. Oh, man. You're gonna deny it. Oh. What are you talking about? Szechuan? McNuggets? What the hell? What are you talking about, Rick? What are you talking about?! What is that?! What are you talking about?! Rick? Rick? Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? Rick? W-where are you? Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something. And? Was it? Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? Well, can you move? Can you fly? All right, well, do pickles live forever or -- I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this. Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? He turned himself into a pickle. Oh, my God! I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. I, I liked her. Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die! Who? Who was that, Rick? Then why aren't we killing them?! Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators! Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded! I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep. Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo! Rick! Rick, stop! Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier! Happy hour. Whoa, yeah! Did he say "three for three"? You mean "two for two", right, Vance? So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us? We weren't here "last time", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde... This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts". I... think the personality conflict might have been... you. Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor? Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us. Yeah, but not heroes. I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine! Oh, God. I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry. I-I-I... I'm not a superhero. Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs. Get it yourself. Just focus on the mission, all right? Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now! Rick, is-is this a "Saw" thing? Are you seriously "Saw"-ing the Vindicators? Vance, stay calm... Okay, ouch, but... Guys!  I've figured it out. It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point. The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself! That's not the issue, Rick! Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? W-Wait, huh? Oh, o-okay. This again? I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk. In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out! You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back. Too many, Rick! Too many! You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe? Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood... Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction. Holy shit. You're jealous. Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right! I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave. What? I'll cover that bet. I get it. ...Motherfucker! Shut up. Greater good?! Never said that! No doubt. Who do we make the check out to? Right? Rick, Supernova's getting away! But.. she was trying to kill us! Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators. Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick! They tried to murder him first. Yeah, he knows. He murdered them. Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like. Man. Glad I’m not one of them! Mortys are human! WHOA!! That was amazing! I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place? Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit! Thanks Uncle Steve! What the hell, Rick? What the hell? Steve wasn't real? But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike. Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that. Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things. What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick. I don't want to go to the dance alone. We shall. Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases. Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors. You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend. Oh -- oh, yeah? I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you! Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me? Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining. I didn't! She's real. She's my bitch of a sister. I-I-I thought you went to a concert! I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me! I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace! Keep breathing! Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep! Haha, yeah, cool. H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still. Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like— Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey. Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing. You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him— Rick! Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick. Do you have a rum and coke? Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart. That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life? Well-well, what about me? I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase. Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time. And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad? This may be the last time you lay eyes on me! R-rick? See, um th-the thing is, uh— Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little. Let’s just hit the reset button. I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together. Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care. Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel. Dumb. There’s a Morty president now. They made it Glendale. Even pooping hurts now. Th-th-that sounds really violent. Oh, Okay. Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow! I-I-I think I feel like myself again. Hey, they shot me! Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs. Woah! S-seriously? Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president. Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were. I don’t know. Tastes pretty good. Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice. We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like— Wait, what? Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P? I wanna know what he’s talking about. We kicked his ass. You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick. What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true! Liar! I’m not busy! Yeah. Holy shit! Wh-who’s that? Does he like it? What’s happening, Rick? What do you think he needed from your brain? What is the Central Finite Curve? So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything? It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything. No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you. Woah. Dead wife? Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that. Well what are you doin’ about it? Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you? Oh my fucking god! Woah! Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it. Rick! Oh, man. Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place? Council of Ricks? Hey, what do you know? It’s a cowboy version of me! Aaaaah! Oh! Oooh! Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves? I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers. You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick? Um… because… our personalities are so different? Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over. Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices? Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building! Oh my god… wh-why would somebody do this? It’s horrible! You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object! You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield! I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster. W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid. Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh? Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there? Help! So what? Y-y-y-y-you’re just going to give up? Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you’re scared, because I’m scared, but that’s no reason to accept our fate. We’re Mortys! We’re not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own! You’re lucky I’m not a Rick. Wh-wh-what’s gonna happen to all these Mortys? Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass. Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little? It would go without saying, huh? Nah…  The Mortyest Morty… Oh yeah, how’s that? Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise. Yeah, I'm pretty jealous. W-whoa! Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something? Uhm. Go inside what? Oh man. Where are we Rick? All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls. W-w-w-whoa, people?  Whoa! Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something. You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes. What? Why? Ohhhh, snap! Whoa-oh! What?! Rick, a word? What the hell was that? No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here? Holy Shit! Re-really funny, Zeep. This is healthy, trust me. Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?  Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing. You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no! Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car.  All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this. That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth? Kalo kada sha la. We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest. You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you. This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day! Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home. Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out. All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the  worst! Your gods are a lie!  you,  nature, and  trees! Yes! You did it! Yes! Why? Aaaaaah! Aaaah!  What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us!  What?! Oh, my God! Don't do it. Geez. What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead. Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it. Jesus. Uh-huh. I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister! Ohhhh… I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were! Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out! *pushes Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun! *suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots? Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure! Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk. All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win! Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay? Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure! You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds! Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. Holy crap. Th-th but that's not how it went down! We're gonna be okay, Rick. Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it! Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers. Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. I say give me a hand, sidekick. All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun. Easy, Rick. Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why? It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure. I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Okay. Uh. B-bye. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Get off of me! Whoo! No! Stop! Please! No! No! Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay?  Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please! Please, I just want to... go h-home.  Really? Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry. Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions. Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo! Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it. This might be the best day of my life. Hey, wait a minute, Rick. Wh-- I thought this was a commercial. Wh-what's going on? I mean-- See, that must be where he lives. OK... What?! Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on... Okay, okay, you can change it. Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield. Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right! Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray. Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music? Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too? Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial. What in the hell? Sex sells what? W-was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff?  Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on? W-w-w-what?  Hey, uh Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay? I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer. Can I show you something?  That, out there? That's my grave. On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole. World. So, we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own - rotting - corpse. I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don't run". Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV? Doesn't matter.  Yeah, Ball Fondlers. Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own? Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh? Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is. Wh… convincing? Uhhokay. What's with Mom? Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too. Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay. Uh, me? Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40. W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you? Concentrated huh? Uhhh… Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff. Uh, y-you will? Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh! What?! Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips* Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about? Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?! Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica. Give it to me! G-g-give it! No, Rick! Rick! I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before. Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick. Okay, okay, you got me on that one. No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?  Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class. Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do? Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous. You got that right, Rick. Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to? Holy crap! *jumps off edge* So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them? I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one. Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it! Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy. Just kind of hard to believe, you know? Oh my god! Dad! Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick! Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick? Whoa! It's all here, Rick! Okay. Uh-huh. Alright. *freezes up* What? Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man? Oh, boy. Have you been drinking, Rick? O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick No! No! No! *terrified, gasps* Geez! Oh my god! W-w-what the hell? What a life. Drive carefully! Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time. Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said? Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party! Oh, what?! Rick, you can't! Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick? Oh, man!    Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right? Hey, uh, what the hell?! Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed! Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?! Rick, you got to stop --  Hey, how's it -- Uh... Not at all. Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed! Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"? Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures! Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?  Jessica. I can't believe she's here. Rick! Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends. Jessica, can I show you something?  Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out. You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you. I think that you're the most -- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting! Ow! Oh! Oh, crap! How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick! Okay. Let's go, then. W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.  Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close. Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!  Rick, I got them! I got the crystals!  Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father. He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.  He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died. Wait a minute. What? What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something! That's what I think of your crystals, Rick! All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now. Uh, sure, yeah.  Thanks.  Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically. Come on, um... Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole. You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.  Rick, wake up. Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home. Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway. What -- what thing? Rick! That describes everything in your garage! Whoa! What did you do? For how long? Ooh, boy, what a waste of time. Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen. Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say. Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick? Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?  Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together? Oh. Ok. Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet. Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it. I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006. You… disagree? Um, ok, I just have to- Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn! Um… Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know? Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing. No! Dad, what’s your endgame? Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!  Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head. Uh… I’d better not. Um… A party? For sure me and my dad are. Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure. Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations! You told me science wasn’t easy! Dad, their whole planet is dying! Um, excuse me?  Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling? Good one, dad. Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project? Oh! Hey dad!  Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick? Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that. Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A.  You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know! You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man. I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-  You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.  Ohhhh... Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?  Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom? Ruben... Minnesota? W-What proc— Rick... Where am I? The entrance to what? Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas? Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them.  Ow! It's really scary in here, Rick. OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster! Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!  Oh... Exhibits? Diseases?! W-Well, I guess we better check it out.  I'll go.  Heheh... I'm not. I'm doin’ it because it's fun.  Whoa!  Whoa! Oh! What are those things?! You're not gonna die! What's your name? Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis! Geez, what's that horrible smell? Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?! Everybody! Get to the colon! Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know... Not twelve. Because he just said I was twelve.  Nnn... Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?  Everybody! In here! Poncho? What is this in your backpack? AHHHHH!!! Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick. We need to get to the left nipple! Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let's go. ...Uh, well... Euuuugh!  We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation! Oh my god, the track! It's beautiful... Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him? Oh. Huh. Sorry Rick... He's dead... Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick! W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno! Cool. This is where we’re going?  Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad? I wanna come with. What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady. …You sell weapons to killers for money? Uh, what? You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games? Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!  W… Where’s my wife? I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people! Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger! You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!  All out of off-white Persians…  Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?!  You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone! Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name? Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!  Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh… No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car! Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away! Oooh…! Come on, come on!  Oh no no no! Rick! Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs! You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick. That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be. I did the right thing, Rick! You did that! Whoa, whoa! Um, Rick!  Are you done? I’m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I’m really sorry your name became Fart.  Really? Um… Cleansing…?  Um… Before you go… Could you sing a… C-Could you sing for me again? Goodbye.  What?! Rick! No, you can’t! No, no, Rick! You don’t understand! What?! Hahahahaha, yeah You're excited about that? Uh, what's that? Rick? Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us? Look at ‘em go! So coordinated! What’s your problem? They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers! Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else. Summer! Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be... you know, life. Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up! I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity. Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh? Way to go, Summer. You started a race war. Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!  We’re neither! S-see? Oh, there's no place like home! There's no place like home! Remember, Summer? From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie? All the tiny people? U-Unity? Um... should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...? Unity, could you get Rick out here please?  Rick! Rick! Uh, Rick? I think we should all go. This isn't healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know? But Rick, Summer's just- Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie.  Holyshitholyshitholyshit. Hey...  ah... You said I could go to school today. We’ve been going non-stop, Rick. It’s not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessica’s single. They’re on our tail! Wha! I can’t fucking do this anymore! So you agree? Why do you... Keep doing this to us?! You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy. My whole body’s like a baby’s ass. I don’t think. Are you on commission? : Okay, Rick, come on. Enough. Maybe you should go through twice. Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no- Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music? I just hit shuffle. Haha. We should listen to one random song a day, you know? We’d end up hearing more songs we didn’t like, but we’d discover a lot more that we did. Hoo, if anyone could, Rick. Thanks, Rick. I love you. Hey, listen, you know, wh-If we’re all bored over here, wouldn’t the common denominator be you? You got it. I knew you could.  Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time. I don’t know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven’t taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha! Happy to help, Rick. It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if something’s worth saying, I-it’s worth eye contact. Sounds like he’s in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldn’t have to deal with that, man. You know, l-let’s work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It’s amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen- I think I know what to do.  Rick! Haha.  You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldn’t be healthy. Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. World’s Greatest Grandpa, for reals.  It’s not just a coffee cup for you, bud. You’re legit.  I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I’ll have a water. Ha! It’s okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. We’re having a conversation. God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long I’ve been waiting for this? It’s like, whew! I-I-I wish you’d shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, you’re so quiet. What’s wrong? W-Why don’t you tell me about yourself? What’s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where’s the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me. Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! I’m an idiot. I can’t believe I haven’t thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. It’s an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right? Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to-  Things are good. Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. It’s all good. E-Exactly. Look, the sparks aren’t flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. We’re gonna ride it all night lonnngg! Gonna eat some "crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm.  All right. You know, the evening continues.  Okay, here we go. Ma’am, I’m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your money’s no good here. Haha!  I’ll I’ll get the next round, sir. Only in the ways that matter. Morty. I’ve been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling you’ve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. That’s the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident I’m on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want.  What do you think about that? Tink.  Mm! Let’s ask my grandpa. He’s a scientist. Hey, Rick, are you familiar with "Ben Wa" technology? Why? What is this? You’re your own person, Stacy. Rick, please tell me you’re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us. That’s what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They they’re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isn’t all some sort of crazy trick? Don’t touch me! Nooooo! Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door! Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!  Kill him, Rick! Ahh! Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. What’s the last thing you’d think about doing with that tank thing? Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd. What the What the hell, Rick? He’s cutting your time in half. 10 minutes. You’re a better man than me, Rick. I’m healthy enough to admit that!  Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you?  That’s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane. Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down.  So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what’ll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You’re the boss.  Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three.  Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm!  Go for Morty. Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location? You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love ‘em back. Because I’m not sick.   There’s nothing to be jealous of. We’ll be together. That’s a date. Huh. How ‘bout that? Do what you got to do. Oh! Ow! Ahh!  Ah, geez. I’m miserable. I guess it’s worth it, though, to know how much you care. Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn’t who I said I was. Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn’t I? Well No-Not anymore. I’ll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones. Okay. Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off? You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means! W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right? Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving! Well, I-I better-- They all have mohawks! Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?! Summer! Rick, can we not leave without my sister?! Summer! Jesus Christ. Summer! What is your deal lately? What?! Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.  Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here? Isotope 322. Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name, and the rest of their name was "Stalkers"! Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the "F" out of "H"! "Distract"? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show? Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?! I-I didn't do that! Ooh! Help! Help! Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible! Okay, no more! No, I don't! Someone, make this stop!  Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet? Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner? Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry? Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today? Whoa, whoa! This isn't over, is it? That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question? Ahh! Oh, gee! L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here. Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir. You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you. Rick? Yeah, well, too late. Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister? Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go. Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I -- Hey, there she is! Uh-huh. I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work. You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine. What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on. We're gonna kill God. Mob style.  Pfft, as if! Shit! You made clones of us? Different h-ow!  It's not important right now, dad! Is this why you wanted to get out of town? I think dad was still outside. What's a decoy family? Oh, cool! Yeah, I never thought of the "were" in "werewolf" like "who, what, when and where!" Clever wordplay! Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff. Yeah. Ugh, gross! What do I do? What? I'm not looking at your ass! Gross! Why did I get punished?  Damn, like Westworld! Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an exact replica? Shit. I can't finish without it. Uh, Rick? Did you use this house to make decoys, too? You just want an excuse to stop trying. What? Do we have to do this? I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ. Yeah, I'm pretty much behind on this one. Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it? It's really bad, Rick. There's one.  Hey, what're they mad at you for, anyway? Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids... Where are we going? Where are we? Where's Rick?  Ugh, it stinks! I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school. They looked happy. Did we have to kill them? We might be decoys, huh. Yeah.
