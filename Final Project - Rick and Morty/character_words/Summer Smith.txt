 Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke. Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick. Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die. Hi, Frank. AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! What kind of God lets this happen? Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! Oh, my God. Ha-ha! No way. Now, be my footstool, Snuffles. Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome. He's saying "I love Obama".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now. Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things? Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich. Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome! Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away. I don't know. It's Indian giving. Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me. AAAAAAAHHH!!!!! Uhhh ... Yeah. Totally. Let's go. Dad, he wants to be called snowball. This is why I choose to get C's. Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting. Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom. Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew? You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick? A competent one. Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though. God, I feel terrible. Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. Yeah huh! Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd! I didn't! Yes, we're back to our own time. Time prison? You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters? Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo! Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? Gross, what is that thing? Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school? Listen! The storm is stopping! Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again! Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight? I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. Father, can we please go to the Ascension? Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free! And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head! I’m going to start dinner! Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires. Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them! You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies! The heads are displeased! Is he going to die? Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills. Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this! Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling! Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower! Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. You're right! Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself. I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do. What is this place? And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer? Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this. He's in prison. He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him. Boo-yah! Boo-nah? A city of Grandpas? But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa? I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick. Grandpa Rick! You're alive! That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me. Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing! What the fuck? I hate you! Aww. Morty, you fucking idiot! Morty, we just got him back! What?! What happened? "Fake gun, shoot me in standoff." Brilliant. Can't we just portal home? Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other? I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan! Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism. Can't you just turn yourself back into a human? How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come? We... have never... eaten poop. And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here. I never said I was angry at you. I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high. Are we gonna go back? Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.
