 Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke. Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick. Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die. Hi, Frank. AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! What kind of God lets this happen? Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! Oh, my God. Ha-ha! No way. Now, be my footstool, Snuffles. Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome. He's saying "I love Obama".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now. Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things? Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich. Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome! Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away. I don't know. It's Indian giving. Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me. AAAAAAAHHH!!!!! Uhhh ... Yeah. Totally. Let's go. Dad, he wants to be called snowball. This is why I choose to get C's. Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting. Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom. Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew? You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick? A competent one. Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though. God, I feel terrible. Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. Yeah huh! Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd! I didn't! Yes, we're back to our own time. Time prison? You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters? Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo! Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? Gross, what is that thing? Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school? Listen! The storm is stopping! Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again! Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight? I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. Father, can we please go to the Ascension? Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free! And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head! I’m going to start dinner! Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires. Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them! You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies! The heads are displeased! Is he going to die? Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills. Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this! Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling! Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower! Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. You're right! Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself. I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do. What is this place? And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer? Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this. He's in prison. He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him. Boo-yah! Boo-nah? A city of Grandpas? But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa? I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick. Grandpa Rick! You're alive! That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me. Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing! What the fuck? I hate you! Aww. Morty, you fucking idiot! Morty, we just got him back! What?! What happened? "Fake gun, shoot me in standoff." Brilliant. Can't we just portal home? Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other? I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan! Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism. Can't you just turn yourself back into a human? How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come? We... have never... eaten poop. And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here. I never said I was angry at you. I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high. Are we gonna go back? Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced. Best uncle ever!  Yeah! Awesome! Someone? Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose. And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble.  You're just gonna make more swelling. All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.  What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're Mormon or dying. Tinkles! It's past my bedtime. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It was Tinkles! Tinkes? See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I. Aah! Grandpa Rick! Why am I always your go-to? Never go in my room again. Nice. Mom, are you driving me to -- Oh, my god. Are you drunk? Your what? Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom! I'm gonna have a bruise! It's picture day!  I want the police to take me! Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem. Yep.     Oh, my god! We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?! You're not the victim here! Aaaaaah! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole. Uh, I’d like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I’d rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system. Dad! I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13 Shut up!  Wait! You can't leave me here! Egh, wonderful. Uhmm... Agh! Aghaaaa! No! Stop, don't kill him! I don't feel safe. No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody! Yes. "Gestating"? What the hell? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now? Correct. If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that. You know you're kind of a dick, right? What's going on? All right, I get it. Uh-huh! It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it! It melted a child! It killed it itself! We almost died! Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework? Grandpa! Oh, my God, he exploded! My mind is racing. I want to be popular at school! Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her! I told you! What? Why would he choose Veronica? Bor-ing. Oh my God! Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"! Finally! I don't see anything. Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me.  We're playing Yahtzee.   Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee,  we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable? Um-- You thought about getting an abortion? Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy. Dad! Well, I'm leaving! Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and-- I don't know, do something with turquoise.  No, you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause of your parents' misery. You're just a symptom of it. Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident. Wait, what?  So, you're not my brother? Doesn't matter.  Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers. Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again? Bye, mom! Bye, dad!  Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party.  I found Jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room.  Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye.  Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty. Ugh. What do you mean you're having a party?  Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something? Is that like their n-word?  screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids. Why do you party? Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones. Brad! Hey! Ugh! Grandpa!  Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here. I thought everyone was welcome. I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now. Yeah. Me too. I should stay.  Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too. Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute.  Cool. I'm coming, too. What? Guys, seriously. Nancy? Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.  You're so wise. Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner. Wow. We are so screwed.  Do you mean this? Whoa! Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel? Dumb. This has been so much fun. Dad, I need a ride to work. Doing what? Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me. Please don’t. Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving. Grandpa Rick! Grandpa, go home and drink! Hey! No! Ugh! Stop it! No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now! Grandpa Rick, I like working here! So what? Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye. I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but… Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me. I’d rather not, actually. Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch? Yeah, I love their soup. Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money.  Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of! Ah! Oh my god! Oh my god.  I wish this desk was lighter!  I wish this knot was looser! Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing?  I wish I knew CPR! One, two, three! One, two, three! Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible? You haven’t failed. No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing? I wanna help you. I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated. Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring. That was important to you, wasn’t it? He tried to kill himself. But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up. Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care. So… have fun not caring. Good. I’m sure it is. Bye. Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make? Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me? He dumped me. Did we learn a lesson here I’m not seeing? Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn’t realise how much you valued my approval? Nah, not satisfying.  Uh huh… uh huh… uh huh totally let’s do it! Stupid bitch! Get some!  Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price. Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha! Yeah bro! Yeah. Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.  Happy human holiday, Dad.  Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums! Christmas drums being played by a boy!  Ethan, what are you doing here? I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday! How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?! I don't know Ethan, do I? Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan!  I love you! It's raining blood! Dad, can I have my phone back? No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't. Seems like something terrible happened here. That's horrible! Grandpa? You mean stealing peoples’ bodies? Ugh. Well now I'm going to barf. Come on Morty. Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people's’ bodies are being used! They're a planet of puppets! Ugh! No, we don't want your dumb balloons. We’re bored. Take us back to Rick. Wake up people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster! Yeah! So you keep saying! Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there! I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to... ...Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free! ...Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself. Oh, phi- phisosophers? Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut? Unity, what's happening? Gross, no! Do... all of you remember who you are? Okay, that's good! Uh... Don't focus too much on the last part, but... Why are you fighting? Can't you see you're all the same? I didn't start it! They're the racists! I... I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams! Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples. Oh... O-oh, yes, yes yes... Dorothy, take us away! Take us away! Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of... a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing. Unity! This place is a mess! Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now.  Grandpa Rick!  I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage! Grandpa, we need to go home! Now! Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you! Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it! You and Unity are like... like... leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other! Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us... because you love us? Take care of yourself, Unity. Grandpa Rick! What happened... with Unity? What the hell, Grandpa Rick? It's called "carpe diem", Morty. Look it up. That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems. Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us? I'm ready when you a-- Give me your flask! I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth! Hold on. I want to try something. Okay, but not because you told me to. They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.  Okay. Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going. How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys? Jesus Christ, did the "boomy-booms" blow up all your "wordy-word books"? Want to piss on it? Morty. Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything! Hemorrhage: This family does. I'm not leaving. Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy! Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car. What about the weird guys on leashes, then? Cool, cool. Sorry. Can I see? Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like. I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache. No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of "mustache," in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"? No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you. Ugh. Goddamn it. Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day. Oh, congratulations, guys. I got it. I'm home. You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning. So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today. Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV! I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything! Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that! Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart. Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home. Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad? Thanks. This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back. So lots of hookers outside, huh? Can I kill God? So thankful this is my Saturday. So someone out there is trying to kill us? Ew. Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys? So they think they're us? How do you know we're not decoys?  Oh my god, we're decoys. Morty, do it! Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room. I still think we're decoys. Yeah, and? Oof. I need an explainer, too. Say decoy again. I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families. This costume smells like ass! Did you let a gym coach break it in? Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people. Well, I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me! That licks. You skipped quiet. Yeah, but you're supposed to say– Ugh, we get it, you're ugly and mad about it.  Grandpa!  Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next? Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?
