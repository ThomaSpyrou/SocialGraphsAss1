'Rick D716-B,And I’d just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.
Abradolph Lincoler,"Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being., But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! ,I have no quarrel with you, boy., It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... ,Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --,Well, no, but... You know?,You guys have any aspirin?,Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured., It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --,Wait. Something's not right.,Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! ,Mein journey is over, Morty.  I have something important to tell you.,Revenge.,What?!,Please, stop!,I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?"
Agency Director,"What is it?,Where is it?,We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?,Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.,Your mere presence in this building violates international law.,And how is that?,Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!,Some of my men are calling you ""Solen'ya"",Ah.,He's just a pickle!,He's not the only one.,Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.,Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building.,Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination.,Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!,Jaguar's daughter is dead.,Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.,Is the helicopter here?,Tell them we were robbed.,Farewell, Solen'ya."
Alan,"I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.,All aboard!,I could've just used a ghost train.,Man, fuck you.,Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!,I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!,Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!,If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...,Nice shot.,You two make quite a team.,Yeah, I guess.,But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.,I mean, really unspoken. Like, ""let's-not-tell-my-husband"" unspoken.,Sure, but were we married when you two were ""stranded"" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!,Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!,WHAT?!,Yeah?,ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
Alejandro,"Hey Rick.,Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?”  And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—"
Alexander,"Hey, wait for me! ,Waaaah! Don't let me die!,My name is...  ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!"
Alien," Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid!  This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!,Complimentary psychological detox?

There’s no incentive really-,I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.,  It’s all good.,Believe me, man, I’ve been working here a long time. I get it."
Alien Doctor,"Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you.,It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call ""your balls"". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!,So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here.,Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-,Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?,Smith family?,I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.,But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?,His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog.,I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.,There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life.

Frankenstein!,Yes.,Yes.,*shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You're welcome.,Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin’. , Love. Connection. Experience., Come together. With love. connection, experience! "
All Meeseeks,"Ooooohhh!,He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!"
All Mortys,"Oh man... I don't feel good.,Wait, who said that?,But I thought there were infinite timelines.,Oh, my God!,Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!,Rick what the hell are you doing?,Whoa whoa!,Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?,Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.,I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.,We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.,W-what're you doing?,If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?,You know, geez Rick, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.,Oh way to go, Rick.,Hooray!,Raaaaugh!"
All Ricks,"Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?,Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.,We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.,I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.,“Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.,This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.Morty 1,Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.,We “isn't”,Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.,Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!,What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?,Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both  all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!,Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.,So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?,Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.,Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God.,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!,Me!,Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?,Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!,Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?,Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.,Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.,Calling myself. Here, listen,  it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.,Don't fall for it, it's a bit.,Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  we're cool now.,Fine I'll just do it myself.,Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.,Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.,Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!, "
All Summers,"Wait, what am I saying?,What's happening Grampa?,Are those cats?,What?,Who?,Ahh!,Holy shit, now what?,Right.,Right...,You tried to kill yourself!,Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?,Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.,Yeah Grampa, way to go."

Speaking of which...,I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.,Oh, he did not!,Do you really not see what's happening here?,Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.,Fuck you.,Fuck both of you, too.,You're the one that costs $200 an hour.

Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair... and your alien prisoner. And... he got away.

Birdperson,"Morty.,You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing.,I believe I can access the history of Rick’s gun and help you get back to him.,Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.,It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.,Don’t be gross, Tammy.,And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.,Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?,I am Phoenixperson.,The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?,I am pleased there is no emergency.,It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.,They are designed to attract the attention of the female.,Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.,I believe birdperson can arrange that.,May I assist you with that?,Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means?, It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me."",No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.,Birdperson.,Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.,My people have another saying-- ""gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means, ""whatever lets you sleep at night"".,This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!,Caw!"
Blim Blam,"Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I'd laugh but I'm biologically incapable, that's how alien I am! And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck?!? So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I'm sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam, out!,You know what? I'm taking this.,How do you- what is this?,Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever."

The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go.,I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we’re all the same because they’re threatened by what makes us unique.,I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we’re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.,I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss’s salary, even though they’re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel’s problem isn’t homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks.,The Citadel’s problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel’s debt.,But I’ve got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message… from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don’t,I know.  That’s why you’re fired.,Yes?,Gosh. We moved around so much it’s hard to remember.

Nobody gives a fuck.,Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training.,Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?,Unit 7 responding.,No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin’ amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin’.,Yeah, make sure you get that down.,Lemme turn over a few rocks.,Aw geez, hey, what’s goin’ on, fellas?,I hear that, ah geez, I guess I’m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno.,He’s not my Rick.

Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?,Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.,Tell me.,Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.,What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?,Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.,It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --,You admire him for that.,Good. Summer, you go.,Good job. Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement?,Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?,You must be Rick.,I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.,By changing you from a pickle to a human.,Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?,Why didn't you want to come here?,Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."

And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.,Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.,Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.,Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other...,...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, ""Oh, the Vindicators are so cool."" I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob.,You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later."

I'm not a superhero.,Rick says ""good"" and ""bad"" are artificial constructs.,Get it yourself.,Just focus on the mission, all right?,Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!,Rick, is-is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously ""Saw""-ing the Vindicators?,Vance, stay calm...,Okay, ouch, but...,Guys!  I've figured it out.,It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.,The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!,That's not the issue, Rick!,Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?,W-Wait, huh?,Oh, o-okay. This again?,I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.,In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!,You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.,Too many, Rick! Too many!,You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?,Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...,Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.,Holy shit. You're jealous.,Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!,I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.,What?,I'll cover that bet. I get it.,...Motherfucker!,Shut up.,Greater good?!,Never said that!,No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?,Right?,Rick, Supernova's getting away!,But.. she was trying to kill us!,Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.,Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!,They tried to murder him first.,Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.,Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.,Man. Glad I’m not one of them!,Mortys are human!,WHOA!!,That was amazing!,I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?,Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!,Thanks Uncle Steve!,What the hell, Rick? What the hell?,Steve wasn't real?,But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.,Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that.,Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.,What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!,This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.,I don't want to go to the dance alone.,We shall.,Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.,Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!,Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.,You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.,Oh -- oh, yeah?,I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!,Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?,Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.,I didn't!,She's real. She's my bitch of a sister.,I-I-I thought you went to a concert!,I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!,I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!,Keep breathing!,Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep!,Haha, yeah, cool.,H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still.,Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like—,Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.,Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing.,You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him—,Rick!,Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick.,Do you have a rum and coke?,Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.,That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?,Well-well, what about me?,I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase.,Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.,And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?,This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!,R-rick?,See, um th-the thing is, uh—,Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.,Let’s just hit the reset button.,I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together.,Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.,Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel.,Dumb.,There’s a Morty president now.,They made it Glendale.,Even pooping hurts now.,Th-th-that sounds really violent.,Oh, Okay.,Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!,I-I-I think I feel like myself again.,Hey, they shot me!,Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs.,Woah! S-seriously?,Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president.,Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.,I don’t know. Tastes pretty good.,Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice.,We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like—,Wait, what?,Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P?,I wanna know what he’s talking about.,We kicked his ass.,You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick.,What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true!,Liar!,I’m not busy!,Yeah.,Holy shit!,Wh-who’s that?,Does he like it?,What’s happening, Rick?,What do you think he needed from your brain?,What is the Central Finite Curve?,So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?,It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything.,No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you.,Woah. Dead wife?,Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.,Well what are you doin’ about it?,Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?,Oh my fucking god!,Woah!,Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.,Rick!,Oh, man.,Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place?,Council of Ricks?,Hey, what do you know? It’s a cowboy version of me!,Aaaaah!,Oh! Oooh!,Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves?,I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers.,You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.,Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?,Um… because… our personalities are so different?,Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over.,Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?,Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building!,Oh my god… wh-why would somebody do this? It’s horrible!,You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object!,You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield!,I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster.,W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid.,Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?,Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there?,Help!,So what? Y-y-y-y-you’re just going to give up?,Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you’re scared, because I’m scared, but that’s no reason to accept our fate. We’re Mortys! We’re not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own!,You’re lucky I’m not a Rick.,Wh-wh-what’s gonna happen to all these Mortys?,Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass.,Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?,It would go without saying, huh?,Nah…  The Mortyest Morty…,Oh yeah, how’s that?,Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise.,Yeah, I'm pretty jealous.,W-whoa!,Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?,Uhm. Go inside what?,Oh man. Where are we Rick?,All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls.,W-w-w-whoa, people? ,Whoa!,Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.,You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.,That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.,You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.,What? Why?,Ohhhh, snap!,Whoa-oh!,What?!,Rick, a word?,What the hell was that?,No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?,Holy Shit!,Re-really funny, Zeep.,This is healthy, trust me.,Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?, Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.,You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!,Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. ,All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this.,That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?,Kalo kada sha la.,We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.,You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you.,This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!,Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home.,Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out.,All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the  worst! Your gods are a lie!  you,  nature, and  trees!,Yes! You did it! Yes!,Why?,Aaaaaah!,Aaaah! ,What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! ,What?!,Oh, my God!,Don't do it.,Geez.,What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.,Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it.,Jesus.,Uh-huh.,I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!,Ohhhh…,I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were!,Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!,*pushes Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!,*suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?,Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!,Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.,Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.,All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!,Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?,Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!,You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!,Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.,Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.,No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.,Holy crap.,Th-th but that's not how it went down!,We're gonna be okay, Rick.,Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!,Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.,Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.,Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.,I say give me a hand, sidekick.,All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.,Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.,Easy, Rick.,Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?,You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?,It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!,Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.,I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.,Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.,Okay. Uh. B-bye.,Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.,Get off of me!,Whoo! No! Stop! Please!,No! No!,Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over.,Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay?  Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please!,Please, I just want to... go h-home. ,Really?,Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.,Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.,Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions.,Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!,Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.,This might be the best day of my life.,Hey, wait a minute, Rick. Wh-- I thought this was a commercial. Wh-what's going on? I mean--,See, that must be where he lives. OK...,What?!,Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on...,Okay, okay, you can change it.,Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.,Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right!,Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.,Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?,Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?,Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.,What in the hell?,Sex sells what? W-was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff?  Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on?,W-w-w-what?, Hey, uh Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay? I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer.,Can I show you something?, That, out there? That's my grave.,On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole. World. So, we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own - rotting - corpse.,I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, ""Don't run"". Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?,Doesn't matter. ,Yeah, Ball Fondlers.,Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own?,Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?,Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.,Wh… convincing?,Uhhokay.,What's with Mom?,Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.,Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.,Uh, me?,Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.,W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?,Concentrated huh?,Uhhh…,Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.,Uh, y-you will?,Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!,What?!,Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*,Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?,Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!,Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.,Give it to me!,G-g-give it!,No, Rick!,Rick!,I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.,Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.,Okay, okay, you got me on that one.,No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?,So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? ,Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.,Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?,Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.,You got that right, Rick.,Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?,Holy crap!,*jumps off edge*,So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?,I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.,Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!,Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.,Just kind of hard to believe, you know?,Oh my god!,Dad!,Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!,Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?,Whoa! It's all here, Rick!,Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.,*freezes up*,What?,Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?,Oh, boy.,Have you been drinking, Rick?,O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick,No! No! No!,*terrified, gasps*,Geez!,Oh my god!,W-w-what the hell? What a life.,Drive carefully!,Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.,Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?,Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!,Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!,Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --,Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?,Oh, man!,   Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?,Hey, uh, what the hell?!,Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!,Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.,Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!,Rick, you got to stop --, Hey, how's it --,Uh... Not at all.,Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!,Uh, Rick, what exactly is ""squanching""?,Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!,Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?, Jessica.,I can't believe she's here.,Rick!,Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.,Jessica, can I show you something?, Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.,You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.,I think that you're the most --,Oh, my God!,Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!,Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!,How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!,Okay. Let's go, then.,W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick., Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close.,Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!, Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! ,Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.,He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.  He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.,Wait a minute. What?,What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!,That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!,All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now.,Uh, sure, yeah.  Thanks. ,Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.,Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically.,Come on, um...,Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.,You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.,I'm sick of having adventures with Rick., Rick, wake up.,Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home.,Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway.,What -- what thing?,Rick! That describes everything in your garage!,Whoa! What did you do?,For how long?,Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.,Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen.,Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that ""wubba lubba dub dub"" thing that you usually say.,Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?,Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?, Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?,Oh. Ok.,Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet.,Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it.,I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006.,You… disagree?,Um, ok, I just have to-,Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn!,Um…,Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?,Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing.,No!,Dad, what’s your endgame?,Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!, Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.,Uh… I’d better not.,Um… A party?,For sure me and my dad are.,Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure.,Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!,You told me science wasn’t easy!,Dad, their whole planet is dying!,Um, excuse me? ,Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?,Good one, dad.,Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?,Oh! Hey dad!  Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?,Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that.,Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A. ,You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!,You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.,I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-, You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something., Ohhhh...,Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?, Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?,Ruben... Minnesota?,W-What proc—,Rick... Where am I?,The entrance to what?,Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls?

M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!, Oh...,Exhibits?,Diseases?!,W-Well, I guess we better check it out., I'll go.  Heheh...,I'm not. I'm doin’ it because it's fun. ,Whoa!  Whoa!,Oh!

He's dead...,Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!,W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!,Cool.,This is where we’re going?, Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?,I wanna come with.,What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.,…You sell weapons to killers for money?,Uh, what?,You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?,Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?!

You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.,""And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?,Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before,I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.,I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.,Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.,The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.,Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!,Where are you guys going?,Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.,It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.,Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.,Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.,W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?,Can't argue with that.,Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat.,Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!,Oh, crap, that sun is bright.,Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.,So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.,Oh, God, moisture.,Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!,Oh! Oh!,Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!,Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!,Come on. That's it.,Come get this delicious brine.,Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!,Yes!,Wow. Ugh.,By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special.,God damn it, I love myself.,Pickle Riiick!,Get that parkour. Get that parkour!,Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit.,Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.,Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?,Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.,You should know those men killed themselves.,They didn't  let me out.,Uh, is this not a good time or...?,That'd be a lucky break for you.,...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.,Oh, come on!,You should know that isn't original.,There's nothing I won't do to see her again.,Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.,That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.,Jaguar couldn't make it.,No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.,Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.,Huh, so you're a liar.,I don't think so. See you soon.,Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.,Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.,Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!,Ugh.,Mm-hmm.,Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?,It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.,Yes.,So I wouldn't have to come here.,Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.,I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.,Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...,Well, there was so much more at stake.

Do people just die when I name them?,Dear God.,Sanchez! Are you a musician?,Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.,It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what.,Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!,What the hell happened?,And what’s your plan, General?,Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.,Ah, shit.,Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to “get schwifty.”,What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I’m the goddamn President of the United fuckin’ States!,Wait, wait, wait, why-why --,This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello?

President Morty,"Sorry I’m late. Never really ends around here.,And I hate ‘em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that’s a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.,Geez, wouldn’t dream of it. But it’s amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.,Ha, geez.,He’s a hot bag of peanuts, isn’t he?,Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.,Fair enough.,I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.,Yeah, you’ve come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?,Oh, I’m fine with that. Make it two… one. Like I said, would’ve been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure…,Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.,You probably don’t remember.,Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.,Looks complete. I was afraid I’d have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.,Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I’d hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can’t help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?,You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I’m sure you don’t know how far they’ve gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He’s an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he’s attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we’re with him. This is why we’re alive.,Liar.,Uh oh.,It’s okay, he’s free to go. He’s the Rickest Rick. We’ll never see him again.,Yay. He’s all caught up.,You can’t outrun your past, Rick.,Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?,Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.,Of course that’s the case. In their minds, they’re the underdog.,And that’s how they justify this.,They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it’s part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves. ‘Oh, it’s so hard to be a genius. Couldn’t you just die?’,Jack shit. I’m leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he’s the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.,And I’m leaving it. That’s what makes me ‘evil’, being sick of him. If you’ve ever been sick of him, you’ve been evil too.,There you go, kid. Now you’re Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.,You can come if you want.,Don’t blame me if you don’t.,It’s just as well. I lied. That second seat’s a toilet."

You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!,Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you?  *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.,*loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.,All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier.

Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather?,Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.,We had a little incident.

Any idea what that is down there?,That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are.

But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?,Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.,Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?,Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.,There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.,It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.,There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.,When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.,Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.,Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty,And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.,Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.,I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?,That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-,Why does he have to go over there?,What new-  what new machine?,Run, Morty! Run!,Don't think about it!,Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.,I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.,They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!,It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!,Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!,You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.,Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.,Takes one to know one.,What what are you guys doing with my stuff?,A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.,What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?,Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.,The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!,Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.,I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.,Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.,No idea what you're talking about.,Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.,Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.,I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.,Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.,I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.,Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.,All right, Ruffles What's his name?,Snuffles, shake.,Roll over.,Go to the bathroom.,Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.,Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.,It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.,That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.,You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.,Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.,Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.,Uh-oh! Spoilers!,I'm a full season behind.,It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.,All right, Morty, time to make our move.,Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!,Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!,Take cover, Morty!,Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.,Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!,Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!,Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.,Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!,Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!,Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!,All right, let's go.,Don't judge, Morty.,Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.,Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.,Time to go another dream deep, Morty!,Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?,Oh, here we go!,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.,Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!,The little girl!,Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.,Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!,What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-,Oh, yeah.,Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.,Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?,Worst-case scenario we're back to running.,Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.,Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.,Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.,Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.,Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?,You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.,You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.,As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.,Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?,Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.,Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.,It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?,Ooh, great plan, Jerry.,No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.,It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.,It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.,No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.,Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.,Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.,It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.,I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.,What do you know, Morty? What do you know?,Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.,I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.,Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.,Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.,Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.,Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.,Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.,You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?,It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.,A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.,Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?,Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.,Ugh, unless she has the flu.,Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.,Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.,It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.,And away we go!,Shhh, Morty!,Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.,Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.,Uh oh.,Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.,Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!,Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?,Huh, what do you know, it's working,Oh shit.,Yes, we're back, problem solved.,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.,I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?,Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.,Ah, God, gross and weird!,Summer, Morty, take off your collars!,Good question. I suppose the answer is,You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.,Yeah.,Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.,No it doesn't. It hurts.,Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.,Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?,Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.,Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.,The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.,Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.,Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!,My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.,I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.,No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.,You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.,Good luck, Mr. President.,I dabble, Mr. President.,Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?,Yeah, not with that attitude.,All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?,Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty,Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops,Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here,Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today,I think planet Earth has just been transported.,Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.,Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.,Genius happens in the moment, Morty.,That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.,Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?,Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.,Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…,Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!,Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!,Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.,Nooooo!,Ahhhh, shit!,Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.,Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?,Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.,What? Why not?,What the fuck? You can turn into ice?,Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.,Ahem.

Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?,Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.,A sequel.,Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.,You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you.

You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?,' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching.

The moment that changed everything.,Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.,Okay. All right, all right.,Me. I used to wear blue pants.,I didn't. I did.,Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.,Nope, they cannot.,Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.,True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.,Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.,Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.,Duh!,Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.,What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.,I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.,20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.,Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.,Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.,Not an issue, sweetie.,Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.,I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!,The point is he thought I was going to.,You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty!

A man's garage is his castle.,Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.,For everybody.,Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.,Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.,He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.,I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -,- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -,- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -,- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -,- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -,- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.,That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.,I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.,If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.,That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.,Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.,For 97 more years, Morty!,I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!,Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.,Absolutely.,Yeah, either one. Either one.,You'll never get away with this, Concerto.,This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.,Jaguar!,That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.,Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.,Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?,I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!,They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.,God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.,Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.,My balls.,Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.,Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...,Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.,So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?,Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.,Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!,Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.,Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.,Did he say he never forgets a kid?,I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.,I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.,Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.,Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.,Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?,Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?,Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.,Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...,Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.,Ugh! Oh, Christ...,Barely.,Uh-huh.,Uh, my God, that's better.,Hey, I can't help if I can't see.,Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!,Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship.

Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?,Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.,Shit.,Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.,Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.,Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.,Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.,Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.,Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.,What part of ""blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank?,Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.,And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.,Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.,Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.,Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.,Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.,You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.,W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?,So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.,I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...,Morty, how many of these...?,Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.,Where the fuck is the lead wire?!,Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.,Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.,I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.,Oof! Didn't see that comin'.,Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.,O-kayyy...,I could--It could be Morty.,Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."",Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.,Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...,Oh, shit.,W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?,Titty-Bean?,Yeah, I feel safer already.,I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.,Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!,Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.,Ah, who cares?,Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.,Shut up, Summer.,Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?,Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?,Oh, for fuck’s sake.,What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.,Every day.,You don’t have to be a dick.,Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.,Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!,Got some of that mermaid puss!,Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!,Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.,Who the fuck are you?,Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an ""Uncle Steve."" That is an alien parasite.,No, you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.,He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.,Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.,No, ""Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.,Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.,Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.,Can't afford to chance it.,Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.,Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?,Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.,I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.,Wait.,No! Don't flashback!,Take that!,Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.,No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.,All right, there's six of us,  and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.,6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?,Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!  Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.,That is su--  -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to –,Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. , Hold still, ""Summer."",Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.,Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?,Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?,You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.,Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, ""Cuisine"" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from ""Cuisine.""  Yeah. Is that what it's called? ""Cuisine""?,Wait.  Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a ""Where's Waldo?"" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.,Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ,You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition ""Zelda"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.,Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.,Uh, no thank --  Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?,So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?,No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!  Give it back!, Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!,Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!,Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!  yeah! Say that all the time.,Beth, I'm your father!,Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?,Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.,Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!,Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherfucker! Pull the fucking trigger!,What the hell?,Holy crap, Morty, you're right.,Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. ,Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ,We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?,Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?, Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.,You're right.  Kill Pencilvester.,I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?,Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.  ,From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.,At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Rikki tikki tavi!,No, Beth!,Oh, geez! Oh, my god!,Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.,He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the ""you shot me"" equivalent of not being mad., And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. ,With the power of a thousand crows!,Here’s two.,Morty?,Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty. Morty, two crows. It’s good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up.,It’s just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.,Take care, Morty.,Ahem. I’m lookin’ for Crowscare. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.,Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.,Morty?,Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?,Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.,Time be going by, don’t she?,I feel okay.,Woah. Excuse us boys, you don’t wanna be here for this.,Morty, what we had wasn’t healthy.,First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.,I hope that’s not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.,Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.,What do you mean, ‘using me as a rebound’?,You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could’ve been worse. At least ‘adventuring’ was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it’s not a real breakup.,What?! Eugh, no!,I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!,I’m giving you free will. Yah!,Whoops.,Wubba lubba dub dub! I’m back, pal!,Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell’s going on here?,I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I’m done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I’m ready to make this work.,Don’t worry honey, that’s just Morty’s middle age talking. He’ll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.,Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?,Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.,Oof, what happened to this place?,Ah, that’s cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.,Goddamn you are cantankerous.,Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.,Can you reverse it?,It’s not a literal bone, Morty.,Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin’s all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?,Wait, what? I ain’t payin’ to store twenty-six years.,Alright, what’s disposal cost?,Oh boy.,Woof. You’re about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let’s get out of here before this gets political.,Ugh. Too late.,You know I destroyed this place?,Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.,Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he’s evil, we’re gone.,Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.,Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.,Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.,There’s the reveal. Let’s dance.,All politicians are nice.,Serialized drama.,And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That’s why you got deformed Mortys comin’ up through the sewer lines talking about ‘hope’ and ‘change’.,Alright, time to go Morty.,Literally ten? Because now it would be six.,You can’t scan an entire brain over appetizers.,Evil Rick.,That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.,It isn’t the whole truth.,It’s complicated!,Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I’m basically Inspector Gadget.,Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?,I only know one man that ever hacked my Portal Gun, and it turned out it was evil you.,Wait! Hold it, hold it!,Time for Big Boy. Duck!,He’s a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?,Yoink!,I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!,He hacked the entire city’s portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.,I assume schematics for the Citadel’s Dimensional Drive. If he’s gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.,Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.,Or not.,Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.,Can’t you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We’re back to simple adventures.,Morty, we really don’t have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.,Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.,Morty, I’m not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.,Come on Morty, we gotta go!,Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that’s the best deal on the table. I-I don’t have a real plan.,Thanks, pal. I-I’m glad you ignored my advice.,Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let’s go.,Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.,Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.,It is.,Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.,Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.  Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.,Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let’s get it over with.,Leave my  Morty out of this!,Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot?,The citadel of Ricks. It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.,As you know, Morty, I’ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers.,Geez, you’re easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me.,Dumb.,Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place.,I say the point of being a Rick is being a-Rick.,Hey, save your Rick rules for the  sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!,Fuck you? No no no no no, fuck me!,You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?,Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs?,I’m the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.,Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!,Oh, come on. Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places.,What? That’s Rick-diculous. I’m obviously being set up!,I’ve heard enough.,Run, Morty!,That’ll keep ‘em  busy for a while.,‘Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names.,By finding the real Rick killer.,Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.,Hey Jerry, it’s Rick.,So listen, the heat’s on and  there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole.,Is that cool with you, dog?,The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.,Yeah, more phonesticks please.,Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage.,Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,  Morty waves.,Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!,Uh-oh!,Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?,Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.,Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.,Not people, Morty. Mortys.,Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a  concept like this once.,On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable.  Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship.,Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!,Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice.,Great, nice work, Morty.,Urrgh.,The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.,Well lah-dee-dah. ,I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.,Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty.,Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!,That guy got it.,Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!,This guy is on it!,Awww.,Yeah, duh!,I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going.,No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.,Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!,Point taken, but this is  no time for arcs.,Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?,I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!,Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it.,Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.,Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would  go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty.,Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?,Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.,I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.,Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?,Alright. Okay, get out.,What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like  ten Ricks to call right now!,Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!,We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!,Oh great.,Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside.,The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y.,You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe.,Morty, remember eight seconds ago when -burp- when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here?,Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, ""Go inside what?"" And I said, ""The battery""? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, ""Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is."",Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.,Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing?,It's time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something.,Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out.,I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. ,It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. ,Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.,Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens.,Obviously  you really  know nothing about car repair.,Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.,Greetings!,Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means ""Peace among worlds."" How hilarious is that?,Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.,Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power., I would love to see it.,What did you say to me?!,Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.,Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.,Listen to me, you arrogant little--, Dumb  name., Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?,I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool.,Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery., Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.,I know. ""Eek barba dirkle""? That's a pretty  up ""ooh-la-la"".,Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. ,Wh-wh-why are you making that face? ,You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien., Too fast.,Hey, uh, let me ask you something.,Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?,Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?,Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you., It's show time., Told you, Zeep.,What? ,Microverse!,Ugh! You b*st*rd!,You're my battery, mother.  That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a  lobster tank! It's whack!,I made you!,Come on, come on, come on.,Pterodactyl!,Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?,Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!,What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!,You crafty son of a--,Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!,Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.,It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!,Hey, that's my deer!,Raah!,My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here?,Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots.,Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up.,Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.,No can do, Morty. I just can't.,All right, not bad.,I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.,If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic.,Hey, uh, how about that drink?,Is our wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?,You know how long a second can take in a microverse?,Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic!,Morty, hop on my back.,Go, go  Sanchez ski shoes.,Oof!,Hold still. ,Aaaah! Holy--,Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!,Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car.,A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.,Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.,Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine.,Hey, Zeep.,Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.,We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe.,You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. ,Unh!,Class dismissed.,You all right?,Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see.,Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. ,Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go.,Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about.This is why we do what we do.,Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.,What the fuck did you do, Summer?!,Don't blame my ship!,My ship doesn't do anything...,...unless it's told to do something!,I don't want to hear it, Summer!,Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either.,Run!,Morty, do it! Hit the button now!,*holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!,Good work, Morty.,*holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!,You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.,I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.,Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty’s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!,Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how simple and fun it is.,Okay, fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.,Every 10th.,Washing dishes?,Yeah just don't do it.,Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family.,Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.,You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.,The Meeseeks fulfills the request.,And then it stops existing.,Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods.,God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?,Can't wait.,Oh, my God, so embarrassing.,Yeah. Beginner's luck.,All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?,Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?,Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.,Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out.,Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun.,Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.,How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-,W-what the hell is he talking about?,All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?,Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.,Oh, boy, Morty.,What do you say, Morty?,Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.,What are you looking at, motherfucker?,Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?,25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?,Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.,Uh, because it's lame?,Whatever.,♪ Sweet home Alabama. Wooooo! ♪,Read 'em and weep, fellas!  Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.,We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!,Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?,Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.,Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.,Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.,What the hell happened to this place?,Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.,Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.,What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dub!  Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.,Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid., I thought you'd never ask., 20% accurate, as usual,  Morty.  The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.,How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? ,Summer,  you just spent  three months watching a man choose a fake wife.,Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. ,A movie about a guy eating shit.  A violent Antiques Show... ,Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous. ,I agree. Where's this going?,Really? All right, fine. ,All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.,Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with ""Schmla"".,All right, that got, that actually got old pretty quick.,Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel.,Jeez. ,Infinite timelines, infinite possibilities - including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. ,Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions, a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?, Here.  These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes.  Go fetch!,I'm proud of you, Morty.,Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. , Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?  Mm!  Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called ""Ball Fondlers"". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. ,I'm in heaven right now. ,Interesting fun fact, uh… Moynihan and Piece of Toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences. ,Relax, Morty. Don't-don't worry about it. Let's just just see where this goes.,Huh. Making himself a sandwich now..,Oh my God! It's still the commercial!,All right, I'm bored. Change it.,Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where-where uh, where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing?,Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!,No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive.,Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.,I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?,Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal t-to the metal, Morty.,Sex sells, Morty.,Speaking of  what, Morty,  what should we  watch next? What about this? ,Pretty cool, huh, Morty?  Oh.,I don't give a fuck what you think, Jerry.,Hey Morty, you just missed a preview for your Dad's ""Citizen Kane"".,Come on, Je- Are you kidding me, Jerry? It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap., What are you asking me for Jerry?  I'm sitting here  trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out. Th--  they've got a clear shot to your head. I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this.,  Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers?, Yeah, sweetie, they-- that's where they live., Look, I don't know! I'm watching the-- same thing you guys are., I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV!  All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day.,T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.,Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?,Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.,Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!,Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys.

Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.,Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.,It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.,Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.,I can’t let you do that, Morty.,No! You give it to me!,Morty, come on! Morty!,Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.,Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.,Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?,Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?,You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.,Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.,Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!,We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.,Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat.,Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny.,Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah!  All the ladies say, ""yeah!""  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! ,Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!,Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*,Come on, Morty.,Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.,It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.,Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!,Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.,Totes malotes, dawg.,Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.,Get in, Morty.

We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.,Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.,Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!,Oh, no.,No!,You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!,All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?,Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?,Maybe you're right, Jerry.

Morty and I  have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage.,Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever.

A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip., Uh, Summer, you can't have a party., Because  I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! ,""Glip glop?""

Talk to her. ,Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.,Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party.  Everybody should be welcome.,Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? ,It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.,Don't look at me, dude.,Kick his ass, Brad! , I just did you a favor, Morty.,Huh. Big star in the sky.  Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters.  We'll be fine! Let's party!,Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. , Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax!  It's gonna be fine.

You can have this back.,Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic.

I’m out.,Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker!  Move!,Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?,Yeah, yeah. ,That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact., So I’ve heard. Just fix it.  I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile.  Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.,I’m being polite.,Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?,Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!, Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…, Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!,Son of a…  Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?, Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us!  Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?,Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… ,Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!,Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.,Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?,Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.,Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.,Morty, take the wheel!,Whoa!,Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?!  Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.,Shit. Well, I guess this is it.,Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’?,I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done.  Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!,Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.,So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.,Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know?  You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit.,Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.,Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.,Hey.  Hey bro. How many people was your Morty responsible for killing today?, Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.,Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?,Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.,Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.,It’s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!,Yeah Morty,It's my favourite song,Oh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!,The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!,One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!,Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.,This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.,I hear you man, cops are racist.,Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.,And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.,Called it.,Unity!?,Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.,Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?,Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.,World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next?,Oh, goody., I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?,Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.,Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?,Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.,Oh yeah!,Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads!

But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know.,Whoa!,Whoa! That's not what I meant!, Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty.,What the hell... is your problem?,Fine, geez!,See ya!,Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here.,Oh my god  you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.,What?,Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?,Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys?

Okay, now put it back on. Haha!  Alright, I’m bored.,Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?,Never! Back in a flash.,Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!,Hey Une! You got any more-,Hey.,Okay.,No. It's your house.,Who? Oh. Unity.

Unity!,I wanna talk to  Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!,I know your game, Beta-7, I’ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!,Well, you're just loving this, mother f- this isn't gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity's not into other hiveminds! It's gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I'm going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!,Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems.,We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch!,""They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy, they just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful, then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?"",Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure.,That was before I needed something, Morty. There’s a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, I’ll be awesome.,Oh, that’s Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead.  Let’s go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure.,Steady, Morty. Five cetons.,Fire!,Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up!, Fuck., Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!,That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.,Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all., Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit.,I don’t know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I don’t I don’t know!,We need a vacation.,Isn’t that something?,It's not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up.,Oof, this guy on commission or something?, Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-We’ll try the machine, but but I’d like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that’s dangling around in the back of your throat.  It’s disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! That’s what you do.,Wow, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill.,All right, mister comedy man, you don’t have to bust my balls. You’re not helping things.,Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?,It’s nice of you to let me off the hook. It’s still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.,Not at all.,What is that?,Are you kidding?,This universe.  Oh, excuse me.,That is an interesting concept. You know, it makes me wonder if there’s an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio. Pfft! Listen to me, trying to calculate happiness over here.,Hey, here’s something no science could measure. I’m real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.,: Hey, kids. Uh, hope I’m not interrupting. Morty, a moment of your time?,I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen.,Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen.,Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live?,W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us?,I don’t think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn’t have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now I’m detoxed and I’m accountable to my toxins, right? I-It’s a dilemma.,Morty!, Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier.,Morty, I’m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can. ,See? They’re living in pain.,Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth. ,Booth! Come on, Morty.,Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself. ,What are you doing?,No!,You said we were merging.,So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan?, All right, you asked for it.,Sorry, Summer!,Okay, okay, take it easy. Don’t do it.,Summer, get out of here! Go!,We can resolve  our issues. We don’t need to resort to over-the-top- Aah!,Okay, just Just leave her out of it.,It’s okay, girls. I-I’m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If you’d like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.,Believe me, sweetie, that man’s motivations are a mystery., Morty, I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but it’s not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-,Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?,Wait. That’s it.  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can’t. It must be by the individual’s own definition of toxicity. That means..., I’ll explain on the way.,Remember me?,Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.  This.,That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.,I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I don’t. Here’s another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.  You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and you’ll know how to save him.,Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments.,They must be somewhere. They ain’t over here, bro.,Honestly, I don’t care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say ""honestly"" you can believe it, because we both know I’m too healthy to lie. Watch.,Hahahahahaha.,Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you can’t. You’re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess it’s just funny because you’ve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we’d be dead in five minutes.,You poor, dumb, sick animal.,Aaahhh! I’m back, baby!  Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out!  Excuse me.  Now we’ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when I’m angry., Ha! All right, Morty, now it’s time we re-merge your little ass.,That kid is a real piece of shit., Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to. ,Sorry, tiny American Psycho,  time to take the opposite of your medicine.,Am I good or what?,You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. ""Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?"",I wasn’t crying!,She can’t keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They’re awesome.,You can’t keep the drones., Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, ""need"" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too.,Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?,Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.,Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.,I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.,Bitch, I was ready yest--,Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!,High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!,Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!,Holy shit, Summer for the win!,Here we go.,Isotope 322.,Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!,Whoa. That was cool.,Okay, getting darker.,Aw, come on.,Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!,Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?,All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there?,Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!,Sounds good. Stay hydrated.,Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.,Uh...  bicep.,No. Okay, I'll level with you.,You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.,Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--,Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.,No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.,Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be...,Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.,The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?,Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here.,Ugh! Hey!,Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.,Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!,All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?,Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.,Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?,Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!,Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!,All right, you know what? Fuck it!,Nope, regular blood.,Hi, sweetie.,Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.,Not a mistake, no!,Summer, state your deal.,Morty?,All right.,It's dinnertime.,Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?,Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --,Well, try crying 15% less?,You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.,Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.,Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.,I want you and your sister to come home.,You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.,I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.,Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here.,The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.,You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.,Ah, Summer's home.,Uh, we should go to the garage.,Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.,Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.,Coolsies.,Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.,Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.,What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, ""Downbeat""? No, thank you.,Big day.,Christian God is real, he's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill him.,Whack his ass., Fuck off, Summer.,Job interview?,Actually, yeah. Something's off.,Don't hunt him to completion!,Oh. Shit. Everyone start packing, no time to explain.,Someone just killed a decoy family.,Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?,Decoys, Morty. Very different.  Very different, sweetie.,Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect–,The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?,Ah, shit!,Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family.,You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you.  Well, that's a lie. Huh.,Someone's always trying to kill us. That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and– take bullets meant for us. Shit.,Ah, shit. Decoy family.,Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!,Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in.,You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20's and invest in the stock market, but then eat people.,Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it– whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.,Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown.,Actually, I get hard protecting my family!,The decoys are harmless, Beth.,They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum.,That's the deal.,Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!,My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I'm real, you have to help me, I'd never joke about this.  There's a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek.,Morty, please, I'm begging you!,Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it!  Just tell me if I'm real!,Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys.,A, decoys don't build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom.,Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!,Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5.,I didn't plan on showing them off.,Yes, Morty, like Westworld. But don't fuck them.  Summer!,I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty.,You know you can use tissues, right?,I know what a fake one looks like., What?, What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to–  okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids.  Isolate head at normal processing.  What the fuck do you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?,Everyone in the car.,And usually, they don't, but again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless.  Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program.,And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?,Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than Blade Runner.,Uh-oh.,I don't remember making this one. ,Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5.,Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it's making you loopy! Happy analysis mode! ,Analysis mode, password 8-0-0–,How do you know about the decoys?,Hide.,Hide!,He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys.,Sure, tell him that.,Killer decoys!,Me? You decoy piece of shit. You're the one that shot first!,And once he knows he's a decoy, he know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he's him.,This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.,Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?,Before you say anything, they were already killing each other.,Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade.,Car, can I get a whiteboard?  When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys.,Fuck you.,Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander rules now.  Really? 1986? ""There can be only one?"" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays ""the spaniard"" but does nothing about his accent.,Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys.,Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?,Engage in B stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.,Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.,God, there's no pleasing you!,Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to.,Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.,Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick's too big, the list goes on and on.,Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let's loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown.,Huh.,Honestly, probably for the best., Man, I'm good.,Oh, shit. One of mine.,Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife.,We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks.,Wait, shhh. It's too quiet.,I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.,You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough!,Kill me... if I ever get this arch.,This guy's really into skin.,Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.,Jerry? Bucket list?,Nope! Morty?,Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming.,You're so mean today! I'm your dad, you like having me around!,Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?,House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a Star Fox boss season four callback? Make it flashy?, Let's go, you little bitch.  It's showtime.  Get centered.,What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter!  I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck, a beacon! That's a great idea! He's got home turf,  a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!""  And now you're thinking ""shit, that's totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake!  I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass.""  Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I'm gonna loop it. Why is it–,Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool.,One way to find out.,Fuck you, I'm real! I'm the smartest man in the universe!,Fuck you.,Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big, long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space Beth. Maybe that'll happen more often!,Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family."
