It is the tenth episode of the series overall. It premiered on April 7, 2014. It was written by [[Ryan Ridley]] and directed by [[Stephen Sandoval]].

==Synopsis==
Rick's just trying to enjoy a nice breakfast, but he's kidnapped by a group of alternate Ricks and taken to stand trial for crimes against Ricks.

==Plot==
When 27 [[Rick (disambiguation)|Ricks]] from alternate dimensions end up murdered and their respective Mortys are kidnapped, the [[Council of Ricks|Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]] orders the arrest of [[Rick Sanchez|Rick C-137]] (the show's original Rick) and accuses him of the crimes due to his refusal to participate in their affairs. Angry that he was framed, Rick escapes the Council with Morty to go after the real culprit who set him up and finds that [[Evil Rick Sanchez|another Rick]] is supposedly responsible for murdering their counterparts while stealing their Mortys to conceal his presence.

Meanwhile, as Morty begins to believe that he's nothing but a tool to protect Rick, [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] begins to bond with [[Doofus Rick|Rick J19ζ7]], the kindest Rick in all of the realities. After Morty leads a rebellion of alternate Mortys against the [[Evil Rick|"evil" Rick]], three Ricks from the Council of Ricks discover that the "evil" Rick was being mind-controlled. It is revealed to the audience that he was being controlled by "his" [[President Morty|Morty]].

==Trivia==
*Summer only has a single line for the entire episode. She is heard saying "Dad!" when Jerry got frozen by a Council of Ricks member.
*This is the highest rated episode of Season 1.
*It is revealed that Rick returned to the family on the date of January 15th. This episode also takes place exactly one year after that day.
*The Blu-Ray release features special guest commentary from Simpsons Crew Pendleton Ward and Kent Osborne.
===Cultural References===
*The [[Council of Ricks]] is a parody of the [[W:c:marvel:Interdimensional Council of Reeds|Council of Reeds]].
*The song that plays during the end credits is "For The Damaged Coda" by Blonde Redhead.
** The song after the credits is called "[https://soundcloud.com/mahmoud-eisa-8/rick-and-morty-e10-credits-theme Jerry's Rick]".
*The pamphlet about the one true Morty is a parody of a [[Wikipedia:Chick tract|Chick tract]].
*The dome covered with perpetually-tortured instances of Morty is possibly a reference to the Tree of Pain from the Dan Simmons novel ''[[Wikipedia:Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)|Hyperion]]''.
*When Rick calls Rick after defeating Evil Rick, he says "What do me and O.J. not have in common? I found the real killer bitch!" This is a reference to the [[Wikipedia:O. J. Simpson murder case|trial]] of [[Wikipedia:O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] where he was accused of murdering his family, and eventually announced not guilty even though it was widely believed that he obviously did it, leading to a very large outrage among the community.
*Rick was sentenced to "The Machine of Unspeakable Doom", whose mind-altering effects and name bear an uncanny resemblance to the weapon from Isaac Asimov's short story ''[[Wikipedia:The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use|The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use]]''.
*The name is a reference to the movie ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''.
*A pen, a notebook, and a coffee cup with a question mark on it can be briefly seen emerging from one of Rick's portals. In the ''[[wikipedia:Gravity_Falls|Gravity Falls]]'' episode "[[w:c:gravityfalls:Society of the Blind Eye|Society of the Blind Eye]]", the episode's ending credits gag reveals that [[w:c:gravityfalls:Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]] is the one who loses these three exact same items to his [[w:c:gravityfalls:Universe portal|interdimensional portal]]. Society of the Blind Eye aired October 27th, 2014, significantly after this episode aired. Notably, Justin Roiland is good friends with ''Gravity Falls'' creator Alex Hirsch, and also provides the voice of an eccentric time traveler in that show.
*The line said by [[Toy Morty]]: "Show me the Morty!" is a reference to the film ''[[Wikipedia:Jerry Maguire|Jerry Maguire]]'', where the line "Show me the money!" is said.
*The scene where Jerry picks up the phone and the quote from one of the Ricks "The call is coming from inside the house" is a reference to the 1979 film ''[[Wikipedia:When_a_Stranger_Calls_(1979_film)|When a Stranger Calls]]''.
*The plot twist in which a Morty is revealed to have been the mastermind controlling [[Evil Rick]] may be a reference to ''Farewell to the Master'' by Harry Bates'' ''.
*When Morty says "You're lucky I'm not a Rick", Rick replies "Point taken, but this is no time for arcs!" This could be a reference to The Superior Spider-Man story line where Doc Ock placed his consciousness into Spider-Man's body. It also doubles as a reference to the shows non-use of story arcs and multi-parter episodes.
*The "hut! hut! hut!" noise that soldier Ricks make is a reference to the policemen and soldiers raiding the tax office in The Blues Brothers.
===Episode Connections===
*When Rick and Morty enter the dimension of the Council of Ricks, [[Cronenberg Rick]] and [[Cronenberg Morty|Morty]] from the end of [[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]] can be seen in the background.
*When Evil Rick was playing Rick's memories of Morty, there were six happy memories, that Rick remembered fondly. In the episode "[[Total Rickall]]", Rick said to Morty, "I have about a thousand memories of you and only six of them are pleasant." Those were the six memories.
*Two of Rick's memories were Rick putting a [[Cognition Amplifier|helmet]] on [[Snuffles]] and giving Morty a [[Love Potion|love potion]]. These two memories came from the episodes [[Lawnmower Dog]] and [[Rick Potion 9|Rick Potion #9]], respectively.
*After the credits, when Rick's bedroom is shown for the first time, there are pictures of a [[Mr. Meeseeks|Meeseeks]], [[Abradolf Lincler]], [[Dr. Xenon Bloom]], a [[Zigerions|Zigerion]] and Rick's flying machine and death ray on the wall.

===Errors===
*When Evil Rick showed Rick the list of all the Ricks from all the dimensions, he was heard saying "You see this M...Rick?" Apparently, he was about to say "Morty" because [[Justin Roiland]] is so used to saying Morty's name in Rick's dialogue blocks that he almost did it again there but stopped himself. It's possible, however, that this was an ad-libbed dialogue block and they left the mistake in just for fun. It may also have been deliberate since the Evil Rick was being controlled by "his" Morty, who could have slipped up for a moment.
*At minute 6:23 in this episode, where the phones are ordering chairs, you can see one or two frames where a portal opened prematurely, followed by the actual portal opening a few seconds after. This was most likely an editing goof that was never fixed.
