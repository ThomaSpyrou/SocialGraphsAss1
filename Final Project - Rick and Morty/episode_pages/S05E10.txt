==Synopsis==
Rick's still doing the crows thing, but a middle-aged Morty hopes to reconnect with Rick, leading them down an emotional path in a familiar location.

==Plot==
[[Rick Sanchez|Rick]], now fully immersed in the "Rick and Two Crows" show, has become an anime protagonist that fights anthropomorphic owls with gadgets related to birds, his crows by his side. After defeating some in combat, [[Morty Smith|Morty]] approaches him, desperate to get back together. Rick rebuffs him awkwardly. Some time later, Rick is approached at a bar by a now middle-aged Morty, claiming Rick has been gone so long that [[Jerry Smith|Jerry]] has died of cancer and [[Summer Smith|Summer]] has gotten married to a junkie. He begs Rick to come home, but Rick again rebuffs him.

The crows sneak out at night to plan adventures with Crowscare, Rick's nemesis. Realizing the crows were using him to get over a breakup the same way he used them, Rick returns home, only to find Morty was lying and he took aging serum from the [[The Citadel|Citadel of Ricks]] to emotionally blackmail him. After Morty gets properly re-aged, he notices a deformed Morty raving about the Citadel being an inescapable weapon of mass destruction, before he is shot by the police. [[President Morty]] invites the two to have dinner with him, with Rick expressing doubt and planning to leave if things go awry.

Over dinner, President Morty hints that Rick built the Citadel and requests information from Rick on how to "bring down the [[Central Finite Curve]]." When Rick refuses, President Morty reveals he kept [[Evil Rick Sanchez|Evil Rick]]'s partial scan of Rick's brain from "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", having completed it as Rick had been sitting at the table, and states he has enough to do what he needs. When Morty apologizes to Rick for bringing him to the Citadel, President Morty, disgusted, uses the brain scanning device to show Morty visions of Rick, as leader of the Citadel, previously having had Mortys tortured, used as labor, and having their parents' lives tampered with specifically to create more Mortys. He allows the two to leave, but Rick realizes his portal gun has been hacked (with internal coordinates locked to the [[Blender Dimension]]) after shoving a Rick guard into it and seeing the result. Rick C-137 then recognizes President Morty as an "evil" variant he had previously personally encountered, the only person to have ever hacked his portal gun.

The Citadel's portals go haywire, killing anyone who tries to step into them, despite broadcast warnings instructing them not to. Rick and Morty go underground to try and find untapped portal fluid, seeing more deformed Mortys being used as slave labor. When Morty presses Rick on his involvement with the Citadel, Rick gives him the brain scanner and Morty uses it to see Rick's backstory. This sequence confirms that Rick is in fact a widower, and that he spent a decent portion of his life on a path of vengeance. The tragic loss of his wife and daughter leads him to travel across countless dimensions (with some even inhabited by unique versions of him and his family), to gather intel in service of tracking down the presumed killer. He encounters many other Ricks, and even observes naturally occurring alternate versions of [[Mortabel|Morty]] and Summer on his journey.

After [[Beth Smith|Beth]] and [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]]'s murder at the hands of [[Weird Rick|another Rick]], (first shown in "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption|The Rickshank Redemption]]") Rick C-137 perfects his [[Portal Technology|portal technology]] and uses it to explore dimensions and do research. He begins selling weapons and murdering those who cross him, later meeting [[Birdperson]] and joining the fight in the resistance before immediately going their separate ways after the Battle of Blood Ridge. He sets his sights on killing the Rick who murdered his family, massacring hundreds of versions of himself to find his target. A large number of Ricks of the multiverse hold a conference to decide how to stop Rick, who decides to crash the meeting, kill the speaker, and jadedly slaughter a large number of the audience with explosives. After Rick eventually tires of it, the survivors assemble into the [[Council of Ricks]] and, with Rick's assistance, built the Citadel. Upon finishing, he crash-lands on a version of Earth where Beth is still alive and takes up residence there, taking Morty as his sidekick.

The two reach the Citadel's Dimensional Drive, where President Morty explains the Central Finite Curve is a multidimensional wall that separates all the infinite universes where Rick ''isn't'' the smartest man alive from all the infinite universes where he ''is'' the smartest man alive. President Morty intends to break through it so he can live away from Rick entirely. He claims that what makes him "evil" is hating Rick and wanting to leave, and if any Morty has ever felt the same, then they are "evil" as well. Doubtful, Morty asks Rick if he came back to him because he got over the crows, or because they got over him: Rick is unable to answer. At the same time, President Morty switches on the machine, which is powered by the blood of hundreds of [[Operation Phoenix]] clones, all rerouted to the Citadel.

Seeing Rick's deception once again, President Morty offers Morty a chance to come with him. Rick himself acknowledges that it is a better deal than staying with him, but Morty rejects this and opts to stay with his grandfather. The portal gun empty, the two escape the Citadel by detaching part of it and flying away, loading it up with Mortys and activating the booster together just as President Morty uses his machine to tear open the Curve and launch himself through it in a small spaceship. Coming out on the other side, he sees the rest of the [[multiverse]] and smiles while he activates a hologram from his wrist that shows the Central Finite Curve breaking apart and disappearing. Finally, he opens a gold portal with an improved gun and steps through it.

In a post-credits scene, [[Mr. Poopybutthole]] talks to the audience about the end of the "Evil Morty" arc and the collapse of his relationship with his wife after Rick caused him to lose his job in "[[One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty]]", hypothesising about becoming "Evil" himself (shown in "[[Never Ricking Morty]]"). As he makes dinner in a tiny apartment, he urges the audience to give love back to those who love them.

==Episode notes==
===Trivia===

*This episode is the second part of the one-hour [[Season 5]] finale, with "[[Forgetting Sarick Mortshall]]" being the first part.
*Rick's crow design closely resembles the cover art for the video game, ''Grim Dawn'', a character with a similar hat, getup, serious look, and crow
*The episode title references ''Samurai Jack'', with the title being a blatant riff on the 'Samurai' of Samurai Jack, which had its final season also aired on ''adult swim'', the same network that airs Rick and Morty. How the episode relates to Samurai Jack's focus on a samurai who was flung into the past is debatable. It is possible the episode is mocking the serious tone Samurai Jack's final season went for in contrast to the rest of the show.
*This episode reveals the full background of Rick and it is confirmed that he did in fact lose [[Diane Sanchez|Diane]] and [[Beth Sanchez (C-137)|his original Beth]] to [[Weird Rick|an alternate version of himself]]. It is also revealed Rick has been hunting down the version of himself that killed his family but never found him but helped in the construction of the Citadel before finally settling down with a version of Beth that was still alive and bonded with her son, [[Morty Smith]].
**Oddly enough in [[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]] Rick is shown having a memory of picking up a baby Morty, even though Rick is said to have moved in when Morty was a teenager. This may imply that he switched families at one point.
*There are some slight differences between Rick's earlier fake memory in which his Diane and Beth died, and what really happened. In the fake memory, he immediately designed a portal gun to escape to other realities where his family was still alive. In reality, he spent a long time consumed by grief and drinking, before eventually perfecting a portal gun - after which he went on adventures, but all the while searching for the specific Rick who killed his family. As seen in Birdperson's memories, he then started attacking the pre-Citadel, interdimensional club of Ricks - not to bring his family back or get an alternate version of them, but purely for revenge. Nor was he satisfied with killing any of the other Ricks, he kept hunting for the specific Rick who killed his family. However, even defeating all the other Ricks and organizing them into the Citadel failed to find that specific Rick, so he despaired and moved in to a dimension where Beth didn't die but was abandoned by Rick at a young age, and Diane had since died.
**Despite Rick's later insistence that everyone can be replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves and nothing matters, he actually spent much of his life hunting for the ''specific'' Rick who killed his family, and didn't try to simply replace his original Beth for many decades. Apparently Rick wasn't always such a nihilist but gave in to despair after spending so many years failing to find the specific Rick who killed his family.
*In celebration of [[Season 5]], ''[[Pocket Mortys]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> weekly updates coincided with new episodes, including new avatars for players to collect. With the release of this episode came Crow Rick as an avatar, plus Forty Morty and Evil Morty to catch.
*This episode finally reveals President Morty/Evil Morty's plan, which was set up in Season 1's "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind." The writers had put off revealing this as doing so also required canonizing major parts of Rick and Morty's backstory, which could not be ignored once revealed.
**Rick references the fan demand for his backstory by remarking "Now everyone can shut up about it."

=== Errors===

*During Rick Stan Lee's freeze frame explanation of the backstory regarding C-137's prior memory scans, a Citadel of Ricks guard can be seen blinking in the background. This was likely an animation error, or possibly even yet another meta gag regarding the "scripted" nature of the series.
*Rick Stan Lee also states that Rick's brain was scanned in [[Something Ricked This Way Comes|Season 1 episode 9]], when in fact the incident actually occurs in [[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind|Season 1 episode 10]].
**However, due to the production code of [[Pilot|Season 1 episode 1]] being 000, the production code of [[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind|Season 1 episode 10]] is 109, which is likely the reason for the error. This may have also been a meta gag, because the real Stan Lee was notorious for making errors in his footnote citations.
*Due to an inconsistency in the memory sequence depicting Rick's return from space, it may not be discernable which version of the [[Smith Family]] he returned to first, as a prominent teleportation crack is visible around the [[Smith Residence|house]] which can likely only occur if a Rick was already previously inhabiting the dimension as seen in the events of "[[Ricksy Business]]."
**It is also possible this was a animation error during the rush to finish the production of season 5. Assuming this scene of Beth seeing Rick crash into her garage depicts Rick's arrival to [[Cronenberged dimension|the dimension seen in the show's first six episodes]], then the crack around the Smith house shouldn't chronologically exist. However, if it ''was'' intentional, this would hint to a strong likelihood that Rick C-137 had a different Morty prior to his current adventures.

===Series continuity===

*President Morty references when Rick got his mind scanned, which occurred in [[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]].
*Rick's "totally fabricated backstory" from "[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]" was, in fact, true, at least up to the moment of Diane and Beth's apparent deaths: the fabricated part that he used to trick [[Cornvelious Daniel|Cornvelius Daniel]] was him coming up with the portal fluid formula himself in the immediate aftermath.
*Glimpses of Rick and [[Birdperson]] battling with each other are seen. The full battle was seen in [[Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort]].
*The Central Finite Curve was mentioned thrice before:
**In Season 1's "[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]", one of the Council of Ricks tells Rick C-137 that "of all the Ricks in the Central Finite Curve, you're the malcontent!"
**In "[[Tales from the Citadel]]", the advertisement for ''Simple Rick Wafers'' says that Simple Rick is "sixteen iterations off the Central Finite Curve".
**In [[Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons II: Painscape 2|Issue #2 of ''Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons & Dragons II'']], described simply as universes with working eco-systems and a Rick.
*President Morty's ultimate victory is once again accompanied by his theme, "[[For the Damaged Coda]]" by Blonde Redhead, but with a new orchestral arrangement of its chorus.

===Cultural references ===

*The episode's title is a reference to the animated series ''[[wikipedia:Samurai Jack|Samurai Jack]]''.
*Rick Stan Lee appears to explain in which episode Rick's brain was scanned, referencing the real [[wikipedia:Stan Lee|Stan Lee]]'s tendency to put cross-references in the margins of Marvel comics.
* One of the shots from Rick's backstory is of him at a ramen bar with Birdperson in a futuristic cyberpunk city, clad in a brown overcoat. This is a nod to a scene from the 1982 film ''Blade Runner'' that introduces the character of Rick Deckard, which itself has been visually referenced in various sci-fi media. A synth track inspired by Vangelis' ''Blade Runner'' score plays over the entire scene.
*Rick's crow warrior outfit bears some resemblance to ''Vampire Hunter D''.
