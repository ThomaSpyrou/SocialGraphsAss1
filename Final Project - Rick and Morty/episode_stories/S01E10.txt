Rick's just trying to enjoy a nice breakfast, but he's kidnapped by a group of alternate Ricks and taken to stand trial for crimes against Ricks.


When 27 Rick (disambiguation) from alternate dimensions end up murdered and their respective Mortys are kidnapped, the Council of Ricks orders the arrest of Rick Sanchez (the show's original Rick) and accuses him of the crimes due to his refusal to participate in their affairs. Angry that he was framed, Rick escapes the Council with Morty to go after the real culprit who set him up and finds that Evil Rick Sanchez is supposedly responsible for murdering their counterparts while stealing their Mortys to conceal his presence.

Meanwhile, as Morty begins to believe that he's nothing but a tool to protect Rick, Jerry Smith begins to bond with Doofus Rick, the kindest Rick in all of the realities. After Morty leads a rebellion of alternate Mortys against the Evil Rick, three Ricks from the Council of Ricks discover that the "evil" Rick was being mind-controlled. It is revealed to the audience that he was being controlled by "his" President Morty.
