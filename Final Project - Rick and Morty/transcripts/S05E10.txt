[Open Ext. Japanese-style Town]

(People are running and screaming as anthropomorphic owls torch the city. A gust of wind knocks three of the owls over.)

Alien woman: It’s the crowmad!

(Rick Sanchez is dressed in a black witch’s hat, black cloak, and black heeled boots. On his shoulders are two crows. Rick dismounts a robotic crow-horse and draws his sword.)

Owl 1: Give it a second. Maybe he’s taking it out to surrender.

(A purple flame aura forms around Rick and he jumps into the air. He slams the owl into the ground, creating a deep crater. Then, he picks a white flower and drops it onto the owl’s body.)

Short alien man: He’s anti-heroic, run!

Owl 2: I don’t understand.

Owl 3: He’s only one man!

Rick: With the power of a thousand crows!

(Rick lifts his cloak and crows fly out. The crows fly into Owl 3, bloating his body.)

Owl 3: Good luck.

(Owl 3 explodes.)

Owl 2: Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care? What’s the point?

Rick: Here’s two.

(Metal wings unfold on Rick’s back. He slices the owl with both wings, killing her.)

Morty: Haha, yeah, cool.

Rick: Morty?

Morty: H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still.

Rick: Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty. Morty, two crows. It’s good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up.

Morty: Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like—

Rick: It’s just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.

Morty: Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.

Crow-horse: Crow-horse. Crow-horse. Crow-horse.

Two crows: Caw, caw, caw.

Morty: Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing.

Rick: Take care, Morty.

Morty: You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him—

[TITLE CARD: 'RICK AND TWO CROWS']

[Ext. Field, afternoon]

(Rick rides Crow-horse across a yellow field.)

[Trans. Tavern, night]

(Rick approaches the tavern.)

[Trans. Int. Tavern]

(Rick enters the tavern and is met with unfriendly stares.)

Rick: Ahem. I’m lookin’ for Crowscare. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.

(Someone coughs. None of the tavern patrons speak.)

Rick: Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.

(A weapon sails at Rick’s head. He ducks and it flies through the air, decapitating several patrons. The weapon returns to the hands of a tiger man.)

[NAME CARD: PUSSIFER]

(Rick and Pussifer fight. Rick ends up pinned down on the floor.)

Morty: Rick!

Rick: Morty?

(Rick disappears in a puff of smoke and a log is left in his place.)

Pussifer: Wood?!

(Rick appears behind Pussifer and stabs him through with his sword.)

Pussifer: Gahhh!

Rick: Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?

Morty: Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick.

(Rick and Morty sit down at a table together.)

Rick: Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.

(A waiter comes over with two beers.)

Morty: Do you have a rum and coke?

Waiter: What are you, twenty?

Morty: Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.

Rick: Time be going by, don’t she?

Morty: That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?

Rick: I feel okay.

Morty: Well-well, what about me?

Rick: Woah. Excuse us boys, you don’t wanna be here for this.

Two crows: Caw.

(The two crows fly off of Rick’s shoulders.)

Morty: I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase.

(The waiter returns with Morty's rum and coke.)

Waiter: Here’s your drink, poser.

Morty: Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.

Rick: Morty, what we had wasn’t healthy.

Morty: And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?

Rick: First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.

Morty: This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!

(Rick stands up and heads for the door.)

Rick: I hope that’s not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.

[Ext. Giant Treehouse]

(Crow-horse sits on a branch outside the treehouse.)

[Trans. Int. Bedroom]

(Rick and the two crows are asleep in a nest bed. The two crows get up and fly out the window. Rick, facing away from the window, has his eyes open.)

[Ext. Crowscare’s Lair]

(Rick approaches the lair on foot. He hears a voice coming from inside.)

Crowscare: Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!

Two crows: Caw, caw, caw.

Crowscare: Don’t defend him to me, I don’t even get what you see in him.

Two crows: Caw, caw.

Crowscare: You’re right, we should be enjoying the time we have together.

(Rick kicks down the door.)

Crowscare: Crow Rick!

Two crows: Caw.

(Crowscare lifts up a map as though he’s pulling up sheets to cover his chest.)

Crowscare: Oh, I know what this must look like but—

Rick: Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.

Crowscare: You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.

(Rick looks around the room. There are photos of Crowscare and the two crows on the wall. The bathroom door is open and he sees three toothbrushes.)

[NAME CARD: 3 TOOTHBRUSHES]

Two crows: Caw, caw, caw.

Rick: What do you mean, ‘using me as a rebound’?

Two crows: Caw.

Rick: You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could’ve been worse. At least ‘adventuring’ was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it’s not a real breakup.

Crowscare: Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other’s bodies.

Rick: What?! Eugh, no!

Crowscare: Sounds like the man’s asking for proof! Let’s show him, fellas!

Two crows: Caw, caw, caw.

Crowscare: Ah, aah.

Rick: I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!

[Trans. Ext. Smith House, day]

(Rick lands in front of the house on Crow-horse’s back.)

Rick: I’m giving you free will. Yah!

(Rick opens a panel in Crow-horse's hip. He presses a button, closes the panel, and slaps Crow-horse’s hindquarters. Crow-horse runs off screen.)

Crow-horse: Submit to Crow-horse!

(People scream off-screen.)

Rick: Whoops.

(Rick rings the doorbell. Morty opens the door.)

Morty: R-rick?

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub! I’m back, pal!

Jerry: Morty, who’s at the door?

Rick: Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell’s going on here?

Morty: See, um th-the thing is, uh—

Beth: Can you please make Morty fourteen again, dad? This is ridiculous.

Morty: Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.

Rick: I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I’m done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I’m ready to make this work.

Morty: Let’s just hit the reset button.

Beth: Well no, honey, not a reset, okay? Tell your grandpa that you’re worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on.

Morty: I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together.

Jerry: Just like his old man.

Rick: Don’t worry honey, that’s just Morty’s middle age talking. He’ll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.

Summer: Uh, I’d like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I’d rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.

Morty: Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.

Rick: Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?

Morty: Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel.

Rick: Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.

[Ext. Citadel Plaza]

(A portal appears and Rick and Morty step through.)

Andy: Hi! I’m the Citadel’s new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn’t be home without Ricks aaand-ey Mortys!

Morty: Dumb.

Rick: Oof, what happened to this place?

Morty: There’s a Morty president now.

Rick: Ah, that’s cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.

Morty: They made it Glendale.

Rick: Goddamn you are cantankerous.

Morty: Even pooping hurts now.

Rick: Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.

(They arrive in front of the Re-Build-a-Morty.)

[Int. Re-Build-a-Morty]

(Morty is inside a glass pod. Rick and an employee Morty stand in front of it.)

Employee Morty: Okay, so… we’ve got a standard Morty that’s been aged to forty.

Rick: Can you reverse it?

Employee Morty: Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle and graft its ends back together.

Morty: Th-th-that sounds really violent.

Rick: It’s not a literal bone, Morty.

Morty: Oh, Okay.

Employee Morty: Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body.

Morty: Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!

(Morty is split into thirds and two of them become toddler Mortys.)

Toddler Morty 1: I like crayons.

Toddler Morty 2: Girls are gross.

(The two toddler Mortys are pressed together into a fourteen year old Morty. Morty steps out of the pod.)

Morty: I-I-I think I feel like myself again.

Rick: Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin’s all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?

Employee Morty: Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed.

Rick: Wait, what? I ain’t payin’ to store twenty-six years.

Employee Morty: Well, then you’re taking it with you.

(A twenty-six year old Morty steps out of the pod.)

Twenty-Six Year Old Morty: I’m almost ready to sell out.

Rick: Alright, what’s disposal cost?

(Outside, a deformed Morty is being beaten up by a pair of police Mortys.)

Twenty-Six Year Old Morty: S-something unfair’s happening!

(Twenty-six year old Morty runs outside.)

[Ext. Re-Build-a-Morty]

(A deformed Morty is wrestling a police Morty for his gun.)

Deformed Morty: There’s no escape! No escape!

Twenty-Six Year Old Morty: Let me help you, this is not a good look!

(Twenty-six year old Morty tackles the deformed Morty and one of the police Mortys to the ground. The other police Morty shoots.)

[Int. Re-Build-a-Morty]

(Rick and Morty are watching the events unfold outside.)

Rick: Oh boy.

Morty: Hey, they shot me!

[Ext. Re-Build-a-Morty]

(Deformed Morty has successfully taken the gun from one of the police Mortys, and is pointing the gun at the second police Morty. Twenty-six year old Morty is lying on the ground with a gunshot wound. Morty holds his twenty-six year old self.)

Police Morty: You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience!

Deformed Morty: Listen to me!

Police Morty: Drop the gun!

Deformed Morty: Death is coming for us all, and the Citadel is a weapon of mass destruc—

(Deformed Morty is shot through the head. Rick exits the Re-Build-a-Morty.)

Rick: Woof. You’re about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let’s get out of here before this gets political.

Twenty-Six Year Old Morty: U-uh. Was I influential?

Morty: Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs.

Twenty-Six Year Old Morty: Tight. Uh.

(Twenty-six year old Morty dies. A Secret Service car arrives.)

Rick: Ugh. Too late.

Secret Service Rick: C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.

Morty: Woah! S-seriously?

Rick: You know I destroyed this place?

Secret Service Rick: You’ve been pardoned for that, sir.

Morty: Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president.

Rick: Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.

Morty: Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.

Rick: Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he’s evil, we’re gone.

[Int. President Mort’s Dining Room]

(Rick and Morty sit across from each other at a dining table. The seat at the head is empty. Morty tests Rick’s food.)

Morty: I don’t know. Tastes pretty good.

(Rick takes his plate of food.)

Rick: Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.

(Morty slides his own plate onto his placemat. The door opens and President Morty enters.)

President Morty: Sorry I’m late. Never really ends around here.

Rick: Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.

President Morty: And I hate ‘em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that’s a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.

Rick: Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.

President Morty: Geez, wouldn’t dream of it. But it’s amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.

Rick: There’s the reveal. Let’s dance.

(Rick takes out his gun and points it at President Morty.)

President Morty: Ha, geez.

Morty: Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice.

Rick: All politicians are nice.

(Rick puts away his gun.)

President Morty: He’s a hot bag of peanuts, isn’t he?

Morty: We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like—

Rick: Serialized drama.

President Morty: Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.

Morty: Wait, what?

Rick: And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That’s why you got deformed Mortys comin’ up through the sewer lines talking about ‘hope’ and ‘change’.

President Morty: Fair enough.

Morty: Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P?

President Morty: I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.

Rick: Alright, time to go Morty.

Morty: I wanna know what he’s talking about.

President Morty: Yeah, you’ve come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?

Rick: Literally ten? Because now it would be six.

President Morty: Oh, I’m fine with that. Make it two… one. Like I said, would’ve been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure…

(Morty checks the brain-scanning device.)

Rick: You can’t scan an entire brain over appetizers.

President Morty: Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.

(Restraints come out of the chairs, holding Rick and Mort in place.)

President Morty: You probably don’t remember.

(The scene freezes, and Rick Stan Lee pops up at the bottom of the screen.)

Rick Stan Lee: Check out season one, episode nine, Rickheads. Excel-uurp-cior!

(Rick Stan Lee disappears and the scene resumes.)

Rick: Evil Rick.

Morty: We kicked his ass.

President Morty: Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.

(The brain-scanner stops projecting Rick’s memories.)

President Morty: Looks complete. I was afraid I’d have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.

Morty: You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick.

Rick: That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.

President Morty: Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I’d hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can’t help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?

(President Morty sticks the brain-scanner into Morty’s neck.)

President Morty: You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I’m sure you don’t know how far they’ve gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He’s an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he’s attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we’re with him. This is why we’re alive.

(Morty sees a montage of Mortys being used as a cloaking shield, Citadel labs, Citadel Ricks pairing up Jerrys and Beths, Mortys going through assembly lines, and Mortys getting paired with Ricks.)

Morty: What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true!

Rick: It isn’t the whole truth.

Morty: Liar!

President Morty: Liar.

Rick: It’s complicated!

Morty: I’m not busy!

Rick: Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I’m basically Inspector Gadget.

(Rick frees himself from the chair’s restraints. He draws his gun and shoots at President Rick as he jumps over the table to Morty. President Morty is unimpressed, as the shot bounces off a forcefield.)

President Morty: Uh oh.

(Rick frees Morty from his restraints. The Rick Guards at the door aim their guns at Rick.)

President Morty: It’s okay, he’s free to go. He’s the Rickest Rick. We’ll never see him again.

(Rick opens a portal, then stops when he notices President Morty’s smug face.)

Rick: Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?

Morty: Yeah.

(Rick grabs one of the guards and shoves him into the portal. The portal sends the guard to the Blender Dimension.)

Morty: Holy shit!

Rick: I only know one man that ever hacked my Portal Gun, and it turned out it was evil you.

President Morty: Yay. He’s all caught up.

(President Morty pushes a button on a remote control and four elite Rick Guards drop down from the ceiling.)

Rick: Wait! Hold it, hold it!

(Rick uses some of his blood and a vial of purple liquid to create Big Boy.)

Morty: Wh-who’s that?

Rick: Time for Big Boy. Duck!

(The guards attack Rick, but all the damage is redirected from Rick to Big Boy.)

Morty: Does he like it?

Rick: He’s a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?

(Rick uses the stored energy from being attacked to take out the Rick Guards and break down the door. Rick reaches his arm across the room and grabs the brain-scanning device from the table.)

Rick: Yoink!

President Morty: You can’t outrun your past, Rick.

(Rick turns and shoots President Morty. It is blocked by the forcefield.)

President Morty: Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?

Rick: I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!

(Rick and Morty exit the room.)

President Morty: Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.

[Ext. Citadel plaza]

Loudspeaker system: Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay.

(Ricks and Mortys try using their Portal Guns, only to find that their portals have been rerouted to deadly dimensions.)

[Int. Citadel News Room]

Rick D716: In uncertain times like these, I think it’s important for me to say: Eat shit, fuck you! The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don’t care— oh god oh fuck no, oh—

(Tentacles come out of the portal D716 opened up and pull him in. Rick D716-B enters the room and sits down at the anchor news desk.)

'Rick D716-B: And I’d just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.

[Ext. Citadel]

(Rick and Morty run out of the building as fires blaze around them and portals kill other Ricks and Mortys.)

Morty: What’s happening, Rick?

Rick: He hacked the entire city’s portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.

(Rick puts on a visor and picks up Morty. Using the visor, he cuts a circle in the ground around his feet. The two of them drop into the sewers.)

[Ext. Citadel]

(All across the Citadel, fires are burning.)

[Int. Citadel Sewers]

(Rick and Morty drop down. Rick removes the visor.)

Morty: What do you think he needed from your brain?

Rick: I assume schematics for the Citadel’s Dimensional Drive. If he’s gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.

Morty: What is the Central Finite Curve?

Rick: Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.

(They reach tubes of portal gun fluid, which drain before their eyes.)

Rick: Or not.

(All the tubes in the cavern drain into a single pool as Rick and Morty go down a set of stairs.)

Rick: Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.

(Deformed Mortys are performing labor while being whipped by a uniformed Rick.)

Morty: So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?

Rick: Can’t you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We’re back to simple adventures.

Morty: It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything.

Rick: Morty, we really don’t have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.

Morty: No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you.

Rick:' Goddammit. Here’s my fucking downloaded brain, Morty. You wanna jump the shark? You wanna know my stupid crybaby backstory? Knock yourself out.

(Rick holds out the brain-scanning device. Morty grabs it and immediately sticks it into his neck.)

Rick:' No-not now!

[MEMORY FLASHBACKS]

Morty: Woah. Dead wife?

(Rick puts Morty down.)

Rick: Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.

Morty: Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.

(A light comes on ahead of them.)

President Morty: Of course that’s the case. In their minds, they’re the underdog.

(Rick shoots at President Morty, but the shot ricochets off the glass barrier.)

President Morty: And that’s how they justify this.

(President Morty presses a button on a remote. Images of Ricks from across the Finite Curve materialize around them. Rick laughing at an injured Morty. Rick giving Morty a wedgie. Rick with Morty in a chokehold.

The view changes and more scenes are visible. In one orb, there’s an image of Rick holding a bloody knife. In another, Rick is passed out drunk on a bed. Yet another shows Rick with flames behind him.)

Rick: Morty, I’m not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.

President Morty: They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it’s part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves. ‘Oh, it’s so hard to be a genius. Couldn’t you just die?’

Morty: Well what are you doin’ about it?

President Morty: Jack shit. I’m leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he’s the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.

(Events from various universes on the Finite Curve are shown: Rick sitting at his workbench with a pained expression, Rick wearing his ‘King of Shit’ crown, an injured Morty holding an injured Rick, Rick sadly sitting down in a chair next to a device with a memory tube in it.)

President Morty: And I’m leaving it. That’s what makes me ‘evil’, being sick of him. If you’ve ever been sick of him, you’ve been evil too.

Morty: Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?

(Rick looks away and says nothing.)

President Morty: There you go, kid. Now you’re Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.

(President Morty puts on an eyepatch and presses the top right corner, activating a beam from the Dimensional Drive. A hole starts opening in the Curve.)

[Ext. Citadel, Plaza and Tramway]

(Portal fluid bursts from the ground, sweeping away everything in its path. Explosions occur across the Citadel, which tilts on its axis.)

Orange Afro Rick: Don’t worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix.

Orange Afro Morty: Doesn’t that still mean, like, death?

(Orange Afro Rick pulls out a gun and hands it to his Morty.)

Orange Afro Rick: Sure, but the joke’s on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.

(Orange Afro Morty shoots his Rick. A pillar falls on him, crushing him to death.)

[Trans. Int. Operation Phoenix Vats]

(Orange Afro Morty opens his eyes in a vat.)

Female computer voice: Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.

(Ricks and Mortys wake up in vats with blender blades at the bottom. They are liquefied, and the blood is sent to power the beam opening a hole in the Finite Curve.)

Female computer voice: Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.

(The vats are shown to be in the chamber that Rick, Morty, and President Morty are standing in. As the machine is fed blood, the beam from the Dimensional Drive grows stronger.)

Morty: Oh my fucking god!

Rick: Come on Morty, we gotta go!

(The room shakes and debris falls from the ceiling. Rick is trapped underneath a heavy plank of wood.)

Morty: Woah!

President Morty: You can come if you want.

(President Morty, now in a spacesuit, steps out of the glass dome around the control panel. A small spaceship is next to him.)

President Morty: Don’t blame me if you don’t.

Rick: Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that’s the best deal on the table. I-I don’t have a real plan.

(Morty lifts the plank of wood off of Rick. Rick gets to his feet.)

Rick: Thanks, pal. I-I’m glad you ignored my advice.

President Morty: It’s just as well. I lied. That second seat’s a toilet.

Morty: Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.

Rick: Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let’s go.

(Rick and Morty run out of the chamber.)

[Ext. Citadel Street]

(Rick and Morty climb out of a manhole. Around them, deformed Mortys are crawling out from the sewers. A wave of portal fluid washes towards them.

They all get on a train and head for a different part of the Citadel. Mortyburg. Rick, Morty, and all the other Mortys on the train disembark.)

Rick: Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.

(Rick presses a button labeled ‘DISENGAGE’. The entrance to Mortyburg closes and an alarm sounds. The circular section of the Citadel separates from the main body, and thrusters engage.)

(For the Damaged Coda begins to play.)

(A hole opens up in space behind them, sucking the detached portion of the Citadel towards it. Rick struggles to activate the boosters.)

[Ext. Citadel, Space]

(The beam shuts off, leaving a rift in the Curve.)

[Int. Citadel Dimensional Drive Chamber]

(President Morty straps himself into the personal spaceship. The robotic arm holding the ship upright loads it into the exit chute. A pneumatic arm engages and shoots the spaceship out the bottom of the Citadel.

President Morty approaches the rift in the Central Finite Curve. Behind him, explosions erupt throughout the Dimensional Drive chamber.)

[Ext. Citadel, Space]

Rick offers his hand to Morty, pulling him towards the control panel against the G forces pulling them backwards towards the rift in space. They activate the boosters together.

Rick pulls his portal gun out of his pocket. There’s no more fluid left in it. They both turn and watch the Citadel explode.)

[Ext. Central Finite Curve Rift]

(President Morty watches in awe as he breaks through the barrier. Finally, his thrusters turn off and he is floating in the space between universes. He opens the front of the spaceship and presses a button on one of his wrist pads. A holographic representation of the Central Finite Curve is projected into the air in front of him, then bursts like miniature fireworks.

President Morty takes out a golden Portal Gun and creates a golden colored portal. He steps inside, and the portal closes behind him.)

[CREDITS]

[Int. Mr. Poopybutthole’s Apartment]

(Mr. Poopybutthole turns off the TV playing the show credits.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Woo-wee. Evil Morty. That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there’s an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need ‘im. Cuz, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo eee.

(He gets out of his chair and walks to the stove.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there.

(He picks up a ramen package off the counter and opens it.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.

(He dumps the noodles into the pot on the stove.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: But then I guess I stopped.

(He picks up a photo of Amy.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Cuz I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming.

(He puts the photo of Amy back down.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day (he walks back over to the stove), ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us.

(He pours the seasoning packet into the pot, then throws the empty packet on the ground.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Wish I didn’t do that.

(He reaches into the sink and pulls out a fork. He turns off the stove and starts stirring the ramen.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don’t know, maybe you should try it.

(He carries the pot over to his chair and leans against the armrest.)

Mr. Poopybutthole: We don’t have as much time as we think. Ooo eee.
