Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.What, Rick? What’s going on?I got a surprise for you, Morty.It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up.Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.What?! A bomb?!We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.T-t-that's absolutely crazy!Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.Jessica? From my math class?When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.Ohh...And Jessica's gonna be Eve.Whhhh-wha?And so that's the surprise, Morty.No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.What are you talking about, Rick?You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.Get off of me, Morty!I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty.Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.Oh, thank god.You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.It was?Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—Um...I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke.Morty, are you getting sick?  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it.I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.What?Dad?What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?Damn it!Jerry!Beth!Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die.Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.Oh, dad…What? For real?Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows!Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two.Jessica.Five plus five.Jessica.Okay, good. It's time for the quiz.Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.  There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3Hi, Morty.Whoa! Hi, Jessica.Can I show these to you?Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!You know what I named these? My little Morties.Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.Do you know what I want you to do with them?Rename them?Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers.Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.Morty! What are you doing to me?!Ah, Jessica.Morty!Jessica.Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.Je-Jessica. Jessica.Not my fault this is happening.Uh, morning, Frank.Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.Hi, Frank.AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!Scalpel.Knock, knock.Jerry?My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.Well, yeah, on horses.Excuse me?Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home.Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.Oh, geez, okay.Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?The mega trees?That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.It's fine, Davin.Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.Well, maybe you're right.Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?Ahem, Horse heart surgeon.Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?Sure thing, Rick.Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.What?!It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.Uh-oh.When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.In my butt?Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, MortyUuuh.And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.In my butt?Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.Oh, man.The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.What? Why didn't you notify us?I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather?Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.Summer?What kind of God lets this happen?We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.  And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them.The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-Why does he have to go over there?What new-  what new machine?Run, Morty! Run!Aaaaaah!Ohhhhh!Ohhhhhh!Aaaaah!Don't think about it!Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.Whoooooo!I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!They're not robots, Rick!It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!Holy crap! This is insane!Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding.You're Morty, right?Yeah.You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.What?I'm an angry father, not an improviser.Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.You're beyond our reasoning!Takes one to know one.Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.What what are you guys doing with my stuff?We're moving you to a nursing home.A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas.What does that mean?It's personal.Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?I do?Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!1.77245385... Whoa!What the hell?Holy crap. He's right.Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart!But—I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!No idea what you're talking about.Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.You know what? Okay.Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.Aw, man.Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh.I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?Outside?Are you kidding me?! Come on!Oh, my God.What's wrong?Your idiot dog!Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!Ha-ha!Aw, man!Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.All right, Ruffles What's his name?Snuffles.Snuffles, shake.Roll over.Go to the bathroom.Holy crap!No way.Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.That was fantastic, Rick!Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.W-w-w-what is it?It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.You talking about "Inception"?That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense."Inception" made sense.You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.You don't know me!' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.You don't know me!Uh-oh! Spoilers!I'm a full season behind.Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.Wheat thins. Wheat thins.I'll take two.Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.All right, Morty, time to make our move.Make it bounce.No, you didn't.Oh, jiggle it now.You better stop with that.Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!Take cover, Morty!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ooohhh!Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!Now bring me my slippers.Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".Ooooyayawawa!He's saying "I love Obama".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now.I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?Hmm?Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!Hey, you don't know me!Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!You don't know m-All right, let's go.Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.Don't judge, Morty.Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.Ooh, oh! Oh, man.I'm sorry. No, no.No, thanks!No, I'm okay.Whoa!Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.It's Summer! Aw, geez.Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.Time to go another dream deep, Morty!What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!Oh, here we go!Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?Snuffles fix. Make better.Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.Why not?I don't know. It's Indian giving.Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!The little girl!Huh?Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!Ohhhh!Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?Do not call me that!"Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.Scaring you?AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?Uhhh ...Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?Yeah. Totally. Let's go.You will walk when it is time to walk.What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?Oh, yeah.Buckle up, bitch!Ooooooaaahhh!Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.But that's the opposite of what-Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.Worst-case scenario we're back to running.Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.You can run But you can't hide!Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.Dad, he wants to be called snowball.Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?I don't want to talk about it!Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa.Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!Oh, uh, um ... "Bitch."Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.Oh, hey, it's you guys!If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.I always hated that song!These halves don't belong together, bitch!Sex is sacred!This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought.What the hell?Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?Oh, man, what's going on?Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.This is why I choose to get C's.Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.- Dad! - Rick!If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.Bad person. Bad.Ooh, great plan, Jerry.Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.Th-thanks, snuffles.Begin phase two.Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.What?It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.But I-it's been like a whole year!It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.Aw, man, geez! Seriously?Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.What?!It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.We are not them! We are not them.Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.I'm gonna miss you, snowball.You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.Jerry?I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller.Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.What do you know, Morty? What do you know?Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.What's up Morty?UgghhWhat are you doing?UmmmWait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!Gee, thanks, Brad.I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager.Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE.Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.My marriage is fine, thank you.Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom.Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.Oh well, okay...A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.Oww!Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.Ugh, unless she has the flu.Beth, do you still love me?Want kinda question is that?The "yes" or "no" kind.Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?Yess.Are you gonna build them?Noo.Then what good was the "yes"?Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say "no" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?Sort of.But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.This late?The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone.Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight.WOW, thanks!I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK!  I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE!Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry.Oh, well, no problem Brad.There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special.Whoa, take it easy!GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.Oh, Principal Vagina.Never leave me, Morty, NEVER.Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?Who cares? Just hold me.LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY!She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting.So dad, guess what tomorrow is...Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.No... well, it might be...It is.Fine, but also, tomorrow is your one year anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes.Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.Happy anniversary, dad!Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.  Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.Should be making us a whole restaurant.Nonsense, we couldn’t be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you.Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks.Hey! What the heck?Neutralise the Jerry.Wait, no!Dad!Dad!Rick!Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let’s get it over with.Bring his mo--orty.Oh, man.Leave my  Morty out of this!You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join  the council.Wait, wh-wh-wh-what about Jerry?Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot?-give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection, just don’t hurt me!  Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons.Our son’s been abducted!You hate me for buying those coins!Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place?The citadel of Ricks. It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.Council of Ricks?As you know, Morty, I’ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers.Hey, what do you know? It’s a cowboy version of me!Geez, you’re easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me.Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!Hey, check this out!Show me the Morty!Dumb.‘Scuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place.I say the point of being a Rick is being a-Rick.Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!Hey, save your Rick rules for the  sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!Fuck me, pal.Fuck you? No no no no no, fuck me!Bring up the holograms!Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?You  have a history of non-cooperation with the council.Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs?Because he’s dead too!No!Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you’re the malcontent. The rogue.I’m the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!Evidence? Good idea. Scan his portal gun!Oh, come on. Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places.Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!What? That’s Rick-diculous. I’m obviously being set up!Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls.I’ve heard enough.Run, Morty!Uh uh, not you!Aaaaah!Nooo!Arrrrgh! Ahhhh!Aaaah!Oof!Oh! Oooh!Yeah, I’d like to order one large person with extra people please.White people. No no no no no, black people. And hispanic on half.Yes, I’d like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please.High chair. No no no no no, recliner! And wheelchair on half.They could have gone into any one of these.Yeah, I’d like to order one large phone with extra phones please.Cellphone. No no no no no, rotary! And payphone on half.That’ll keep ‘em  busy for a while.Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves?‘Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names.By finding the real Rick killer.I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers.Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep ‘em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer.Who wants lemonade?Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!Beth,  you’re a treasure.I have a Beth just like you in my  reality, except you know what? She’s not as brilliant or  attractive!Aww, thank  you!Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!Uh, hello?Hey Jerry, it’s Rick.Rick! Heyy. Haha, what’s- what’s up?So listen, the heat’s on and  there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole.What?Is that cool with you, dog?Rick, no! Mortyyyy!I got it! The call’s coming from… inside the house! The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.Phones á la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. Anything else?Yeah, more phonesticks please.Right away, sir.You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage.Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,  Morty waves.Um… because… our personalities are so different?Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!Uh-oh!‘Scuse me, we’ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I’m going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they’re the evil one, you’ll know who’s lying.Hey, check it out!Dammit!Hey, you didn’t pay your bill!The red X! Red X!Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over.Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building!Not people, Morty. Mortys.Oh my god… wh-why would somebody do this? It’s horrible!Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a  concept like this once.On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable.  Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship.Coffee time!Ugh.Hi Jerry!Leave me alone, I’m working!Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?Ugh. I’m- I’m in between advertising jobs.Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?W-well, it’s a little more complicated than that…Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together! Dude, are you… wh- you’re being a dick, right?Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn’t want to offend you in any way!You’re really a Rick?Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty’s a Morty!Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ‘Mask.’ You know, the one with Cher in it?That’s right, Jerry! He-he’s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He’s Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because… I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I’d love ‘em  if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.Hey, get a load of this! Jerry’s hanging out with doofus Rick.Haha, this is perfect.I’m not doofus Rick! I’m Rick J-19-Zeta-7!Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?Hey! I don’t eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!I guess it’s only fair to tell you now, Jerry… I’m the worst Rick of them all.According to who? Other versions of you? If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself.Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that’s why you work in advertising!The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object!Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield!Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice.Great, nice work, Morty.Urrgh.Ooh, look at you, C-137! You’re- aren’t you a tough customer?The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.Not in this dimension it isn’t. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before.Well lah-dee-dah. Hey, that’s mine!I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster.Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty.W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid.Take his Morty away.Come with me.Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there?It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.In here.Ahh, isn’t it beautiful?Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!Hehehehehehehehehe.That guy got it.Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You’re missing my symphony.Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!Hehehehehehehehehe.This guy is on it!He’s not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That’s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds.Hehehehehehehehehe.Awww.See, Rick, you’re not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We’re not so  different, you and I.Yeah, duh!See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed ‘em out from most evil to least evil. Here’s where I am. And look at right here’s where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird.I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going.Please. I think I’m doing pretty good on my own. I’m simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you.Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies!It’s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order!Well, come on, I can’t take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C’mere Jerry!Hey, uh. C’mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something.Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but… you’re a genius scientist, what do you think? There’s little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!You know Jerry, I’m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is… you bought ‘em ‘cause you like ‘em. They have value to you. That’s what matters. How long are you staying?Until we find your Rick. I found mine. I found mine.Help!There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world.So what? Y-y-y-y-you’re just going to give up?We’re giving in to the power of the One True Morty. One day he will return!Praise the One True Morty!Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you’re scared, because I’m scared, but that’s no reason to accept our fate. We’re Mortys! We’re not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own!This sounds like something the One True Morty might say. I’m sick of being a human shield! I-I-I-I wanna be a gardener!I wanna write really crazy, intense action novels!I’m more than just a hammer!He is the one true Morty! The one true Morty!Hooray!Hey, keep it down!Raaaaugh!You’ve lived quite a life, Rick. It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through.You’re crying? Over a Morty?No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe, it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys.Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!You’re lucky I’m not a Rick.Point taken, but this is  no time for arcs.Yeah, hello?Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?Huh? Wh-who is this?I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!Yo ding-dong! We’re done here. Time to go.Well Jerry, I  guess this means goodbye.W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe… you know… get rid of him? I’m not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I’m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn’t work. It’s time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya.Wh-wh-what’s gonna happen to all these Mortys?They’ll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls… poor little Rickless bastards.Earth Rick C-137, the council apologises for its false accusation. And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty, in the event that  your current  Morty should-Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it.Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass.Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would  go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty.It would go without saying, huh?Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?Nah…  The Mortyest Morty…Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.Oh yeah, how’s that?I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.What a mess…Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.What is that?Hand me the laser defibrillator.Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you’ll make friends with some turds!You make us ashamed to be ourselves!My god! I’ve seen this technology before! This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver!Yeah, but where’s the transmitter?Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.Alright. Okay, get out.What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like  ten Ricks to call right now!Run!*incoherent zombie noises*Morty, do it! Hit the button now!I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!*holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart.Ohhhh…Good work, Morty.*holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were!I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty’s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!*pushes Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how simple and fun it is.*suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?Okay, fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!Every 10th.Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.Washing dishes?No. The opposite. Can you fix it?Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?Yeah just don't do it.Grandpa!Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family.Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.Yes, siree!The Meeseeks fulfills the request.All done! Wow!And then it stops existing.Oh, my God, he exploded!Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods.All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!So many possibilities.My mind is racing.If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.I'm Mr. Meeseeks!I want to be popular at school!Ooh, okay!Summer, what did I just-Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!I want I want to be a more complete woman!Beth!Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple."Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.Ooh, yeah! Can do!Nailed it.God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?Can't wait.Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!Oh, my God, so embarrassing.At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures!You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!Yeah. Beginner's luck.In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you!Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- - No, I'll get your info from Summer.I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...-- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon.She's still there, Beth.Well, her waistline isn't.Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.You're saying I should leave Jerry.  I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.More wine?I think I've had enough.Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.Yeah, yeah. I got it.That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down.Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up.I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.No, Jerry, I'm the one who SUCKS! Let me try something.I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.Hi!Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?Ooh, he's trying!All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.I smell the blood of- whoop!Holy crap.Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out.Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"Th-th but that's not how it went down!Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that.Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun.Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.The most important love you can receive is from yourself.Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!Just try to relax.You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!  Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through.Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.You're kidding me.Notice anything different?I'm sorry. Hours?Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird.Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.We're gonna be okay, Rick.How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.W-what the hell is he talking about?They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.Oh, boy, Morty.Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.What do you say, Morty?I say give me a hand, sidekick.to make this easier an * will be put next to meeseeks every time a different meeseeks talks.Everybody shut up! Let me try!  Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!I'm going out.Wait. What?Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner.AWWWWWWW!Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this?'Cause he roped me into this!Well, him over there, he roped me into this!Well, he roped me into this!Well, what about me? He roped me into this.Well, that one over there roped me into this.Well, he roped me into this.Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.What are you looking at, motherfucker?Easy, Rick.Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.Rats! What a shame.Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?Uh, because it's lame?It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!Whatever.It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst.Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through!I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!Kill him!Hisssss! How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean!Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.Nice. Is it a fun adventure?I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.Well, isn't that what adventures do?Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.Yeah. Okay. Uh. B-bye.Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.Stop fighting me! Just let this happen!Get off of me!♪ Sweet home Alabama. Wooooo! ♪Whoo! No! Stop! Please!Stop being such a fucking tease, you sweet little twat!No! No!Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done.The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game!No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game.Where's he going with this? What does he mean?When we kill him!Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.Where would you go?I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?What the heck?There he is!Run, Jerry!Come on out, Jerry!Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?Read 'em and weep, fellas!  Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over.We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay?  Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please!Please, I just want to... go h-home. Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?Really?Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.Buckle up! Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask...  ...what's your name, ma'am?Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you.I'm counting to three, Jerry.Ooooohhh!What the fuck is going on?He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!Ooh, nice! I think we'll take our food to go.No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.Fair enough.Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.So... You still thinking about taking that trip?Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task."Was I one of those guys?The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.Well... I got you pregnant.Yeah...What the hell happened to this place?Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible.Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.No. No more boxes.What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dub!  Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.I don't get it.Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean's closet.  We have to tell the people.Wait. Destroy it.  Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.Cynthia...Oh, my God! No, no..!I told you!Hold on.Will you please... NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.What?Yes!Called it.Why would he choose Veronica?Because he loves her?Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.Okay, I've got an idea, Rick: you show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that. I thought you'd never ask.Hey!Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions. 20% accurate, as usual,  Morty.  The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? We're not so different. We're both corn of action.Yeah... But one of us is dead corn! Bor-ing.Summer,  you just spent  three months watching a man choose a fake wife.So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn?Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. This shit is delicious.A movie about a guy eating shit.  A violent Antiques Show... It's a pleasure to have you.The pleasure's all mine.Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous. Wait!What in the hell?I agree. Where's this going?No, the other thing! Go back!Really? All right, fine. Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore.All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.Coming up next on "Shmloo's the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare.Shmlantha, Schmlona!Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla".Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan--All right, that got, that actually got old pretty quick. Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel.Go back, go back!Jeez. You speak da tru-tru.Oh my God! Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!I'm in "Cloud Atlas"! What's "Cloud Atlas"?Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru.How is this possible?Infinite timelines, infinite possibilities - including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. And now, another Quick Mystery.I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty!I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints.Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.Here's another Quick Mystery.My mother's dead!And I killed her. Here's the weapon. And cuff me, thank you very much.Guilty! Sentenced to murder.Here's anothe--I'm the killer! Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions, a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?Narcissism. The narcisstic stuff. I want to obsess about myself. Here.  These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes.  Go fetch! Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!I'm proud of you, Morty.Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't-- I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing!  And also I can't feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee--  Give me those! What do you see?Whiteness... Pure whiteness.You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp! Haven't we spent enough time on you?  I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon. I am a real surgeon.Ahh, uh-- Summer's turn! Finally! I don't see anything.Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born-- That came out wrong, that came out very wrong.Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me.  We're playing Yahtzee.Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brand-new Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise.  It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy Deezy Mc-fucking Deluxe.Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And that's when things got knocked into 12th gear.Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize. Come on! Time's up!  I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie.  You get the idea. I work with lions.  Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee,  we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable?When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables! What are you talking about?All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"Um--Well now you know: you'd be a doctor.  Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht--  banging Kristen Stewart!You thought about getting an abortion?Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So you're welcome.Yeah, you're welcome.Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy. Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?  Mm!  Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. I'm in heaven right now. This might be the best day of my life.So now what do we do?That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.Dad!What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.Well, I'm leaving!You can't leave, you're 17!Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and-- I don't know, do something with turquoise. It's Saturday Night Live! Starring A Piece of Toast! Two guys with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Garmanarnar! Three s-- uh uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to that one. A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all, and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan!Interesting fun fact, uh… Moynihan and Piece of Toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences. Hey, are you tired of real doors, cluttering up your house, where you open 'em, and they actually go somewhere?  And you go in another room? Get on down to "Real Fake Doors"! That's us. Fill a whole room up with 'em. See? Watch, check this out!  Won't open. Won't open. Not this one, not this one. None of 'em open! FakeDoors.com is our website, so check it out for a lot of really great deals on fake doooooooors! Hey, wait a minute, Rick. Wh-- I thought this was a commercial. Wh-what's going on? I mean--Relax, Morty. Don't-don't worry about it. Let's just just see where this goes. Step on it, we all got places to be!  Son of a bitch! See, that must be where he lives. OK...Huh. Making himself a sandwich now.. Hey everybody! So this is my house, I just made a sandwich, peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors!What?!Oh my God! It's still the commercial!We have fake doors like you wouldn't believe! What are you worried about? Come get fake doors. Call us up, and order some fake doors today. Don't even hesitate, Don't even worry and don't even...All right, I'm bored. Change it.Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on......give it a second thought. That's our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here's another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors! Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms.Okay, okay, you can change it.Don't even worry about it! I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas.Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where-where uh, where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing?Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right!Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy, fuck you, Jon. You dumb, stupid, idiot.Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh?You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white uh, uh guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage.Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's-- you know you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.I don't give a fuck! I'm Gazorpazorp-fucking-field, bitch!  Now give me my fucking enchiladas!Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive.Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?Did you really talk me out of the abortion? Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to... do something with turquoise.Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.So, we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves... or...Or?Man. Woman. And now, trunk man? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners. But we don't like the idea of these people getting married. Put a line in the sand everybody--, people! Vote no on proposition XW2.The act that says that gay uh trunk people can get married. Who needs it?Not on my watch!Paid for by Michael Denny and The Denny Singers. Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want I-I feel love in my heart, too, just like you. I want to be able to express that love, with both a man and a woman. And I won't be able to if Denny and The Denny Singers get their way.Hey, let the trunk people have sex and get married, huh?Paid for by... Trunk People. Oh, I love me Strawberry Smiggles! Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me, and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles. I'm going to eat every last one of them, because and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them. Except for me, because they're going to be all inside my stomach. I'm my name is Mister... Tophat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pig-dul smiggles. I'm keeping 'em all for me.No! Get away from me! Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles! No!   Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! It hurts! My entrails are out! Why would you even want to eat these? They're-they're soaked with my stomach acid! Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit! Save me! Take me to the light! Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming!Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal t-to the metal, Morty.In a world, where muscular mannies are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three unmuscular Michaels.Get down! Hurry, run!And that's when real - Turbulent - Juice is coming, and you gotta take care of it. With Turbulent Juice, turbulent tables, no room is safe from the turbulent power of Turbulent Juice.What in the hell?Sex sells, Morty.Sex sells what? W-was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff?  Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on?Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty. And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy.W-w-w-what?Speaking of  what, Morty,  what should we  watch next? What about this? Baby Legs, you're a good detective… but not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs.Hey there.Detective, I'm-- this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner.Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill. Wow! You sure found this guy quick!Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective. Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal!Oh, fuck it, I'm the killer. I'm running, running real quick.Baby Legs, here we go!  That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast.  All right, I'm not going to get him. I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson.I'm coming, Baby Legs! I'm Regular Legs!  We got him!Hey, that was good team work.Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner. But I'm proud of you that you did it.Hey thanks, chief!Now get the fuck out of here!Pretty cool, huh, Morty?  Oh.Uh, I thought it was cool.I don't give a fuck what you think, Jerry. Hey, uh Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay? I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer.No, you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause of your parents' misery. You're just a symptom of it.Can I show you something?Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident. That, out there? That's my grave.Wait, what? On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole. World. So, we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own - rotting - corpse.So, you're not my brother?I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don't run". Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?Mrs. Sullivan always planned to leave everything to her cats. But sometimes, plans need a helping paw. What are the kitties to do, but buckle together and work as a team.Mrs. Sullivan, I uh, please forgive me for being forward, but your eyes are so beautiful!Wait, this is an actual movie?This fall, sparks will fly! Mrs. --Ooh, Sullivan-- ohh...Between one guy, who can't get a break...There's something about you, Mrs. Sullivan....and nine cats who break all the rules. Last Will and Testa-meow: Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's House 2.Well, somebody in Hollywood just lost their job.Written and directed by Jerry Smith.I wrote and directed that? What am I, nuts?Hey Morty, you just missed a preview for your Dad's "Citizen Kane".Doesn't matter. Hey, if your, uh, mother and I had to split custody - who would you guys choose?Doesn't matter.  Oh...Breaking News: Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit after suffering an apparent breakdown.Don't even think about it.Come on, Je- Are you kidding me, Jerry? It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap. It's my life, and we're watching it.  You did it, Beth. You really nailed it. You're a surgeon. A human surgeon. Yay you win. Where the hell am I going? What are you asking me for Jerry?  I'm sitting here  trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out. Th--  they've got a clear shot to your head. I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this.  Jerry? J-Jerry Smith? Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school. I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart. I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I've never stopped thinking about what might've been.  Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers?Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers.Yeah, Ball Fondlers.Ha-ha, Hamster-in-Butt-World Weather is done, and now it's sports time, coming up.Oh, hello there!Good day to you, Miss.So, the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people? Yeah, sweetie, they-- that's where they live.Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own? Look, I don't know! I'm watching the-- same thing you guys are.Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again? I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV!  All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day.Ooh! Family vacation!T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.Wh… convincing?Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!Uhhokay.*robotic* I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. What's with Mom?Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is?  Morty?Uh, me?What is 5 x 9?Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.Whoo! Way to go, Morty!Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!*spying from outside* Interesting…W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?Oh, that's a good question.Concentrated huh?Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?Uhhh…Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.Uh, y-you will?Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.*kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!He doesn't care.Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!Take a shower with me, Morty.What?!Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.I can’t let you do that, Morty.Give it to me!No! You give it to me!G-g-give it!Morty, come on! Morty!No, Rick!Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!I think we should make Kevin look, sir.What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder.  There's another real human in the simulator.Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he?Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.*sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.*inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*Rick!Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?Okay, okay, you got me on that one.Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.National Apple Farmers of America…Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.  Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry.  With that, I give you your new slogan!  Well, say something! Do you like it?Yes.You do?Yes.So I sold it? I sold the idea?Yes.Oh my god! Thank you!*shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You're welcome.Hey! I just sold my first pitch!Slow down!Lookin' good.My man! *answers phone* Hello.Guess who just sold the apples campaign.Who just sold the apples campaign?Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someone was wrong.Yes.Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.Okay.Wait, really?Yes.Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!Lookin' good.Slow down!My man! *glitches into a tree*Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat.Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, "The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter," for a crowd this tiny.You got that right, Rick.Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah!  All the ladies say, "yeah!"  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! *kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "L" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*Holy crap!Come on, Morty.*jumps off edge*Sir, they're over the edge.Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.Totes malotes, dawg.Just kind of hard to believe, you know?Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?*snaps fingers* Yes.Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. "Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?" It's almost identical.*snaps fingers* Yes.Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.*snaps fingers* Yes.*crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in "Hungry for Apples" that's shared by "Got milk?" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!*snaps fingers* Yes.Yeah! Wait. Really?*snaps fingers* Yes.Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.*snaps fingers* Yes.I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.*snaps fingers* Yes.Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?*snaps fingers* Yes.Could we nominate me?*snaps fingers* Yes.Holy crap!Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.  Huh. I thought I entered the code right. Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.Uhh…We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!That is why you're never getting home. Get them!RUN MORTY!Oh my god!I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.My man!Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!My my my my man!Aah! What the hell?!  No.Jerry?!Dad!What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them**sobbing* No!Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.Whoa! It's all here, Rick!Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!*freezes up*Oh, no.What the…?No!*laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?I don't know. Can you?Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you?  *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?*loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient…Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.So… What do you think?You're fired.Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?Hey, Morty.What?Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.Oh, boy.You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?Have you been drinking, Rick?I really appreciate you, Morty.O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick*suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty’s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!No! No! No!You little son of a bitch!*terrified, gasps*I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good… You're a good kid, Morty.Geez!Y-you're a good… You're a good kid. *passes out*Oh my god!*snores*W-w-what the hell? What a life.Bye, mom! Bye, dad!Drive carefully!Have fun, you two.Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our...  Titanic-themed getaway. Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here.I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I  have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage. Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.That's right.Wait... What?Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song "blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop". You guys know that song?  From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?No-nobody?  A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip. Not one thing out of place.Not a single thing. Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party. I found Jello.Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room.  Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty.Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party! Uh, Summer, you can't have a party.Ugh. Because  I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!What do you mean you're having a party?  Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?"Glip glop?" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that.Is that like their n-word?It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17.Why do you party?To get  wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable. Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow! Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read.Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio.  This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone. Well, what about her?Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line? I, uh -- I could get into trouble. We won't tell.So... You're a Titanic fanatic?Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate.Happy to help... rose. I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it...Brad! Hey!Yo. Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk.Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?Ugh! Grandpa!Birdperson!I am pleased there is no emergency.Oh, there's an emergency, all right.  A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah.  Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson.Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?Uh... people? Mm, six.Yo! What up, my glip glops?!Oh, man!   Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?Hey, uh, what the hell?!Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally.Rick, you got to stop --Morty! Have you met Gearhead? Hey, how's it -- Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?Uh... Not at all.Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago...Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.Have a little perspective.Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!Aw! Squanchy!Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!All right! I like your squanch! Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"?Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax.Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me? Jessica.Knock it off, Slow Mobius!Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!I can't believe she's here.Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.Oh, Rose.Whee!Is that what I think it is? Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.It's so romantic.I can't wait to do that with Beth.I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested. Look! Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Uh, sir? There's not a problem.What do you mean there's not a problem?The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!Well, do something! Steer into it! I'm trying!It's too late.  Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves.No! What happened?!Their rail system must have failed.Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!Totally gonna get laid tonight.  I like your feathers.They are designed to attract the attention of the female.It's working.Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... I believe birdperson can arrange that.Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her. Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party.  Everybody should be welcome.Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? I thought everyone was welcome.It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being. But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! Whoa. What's up, man?I have no quarrel with you, boy."Boy"? What's that supposed to mean?  It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... Don't look at me, dude.Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so -- So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!Well, no, but... You know?What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?Leave him alone, Brad.Stay out of this, Jessica!Kick his ass, Brad!  Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!Brad!Rick! I just did you a favor, Morty.Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends. Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.Jessica, can I show you something?Wow! Look at all this stuff. Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.It's beautiful.You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.What's that, Morty?I think that you're the most --No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. Aah!Oh, my God!Hey, I'm squanching in here!Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!Huh. Big star in the sky.  Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters.  We'll be fine! Let's party!♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick! Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax!  It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals.  Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.Okay. Let's go, then.W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?Yeah. Me too. I should stay.You guys have any aspirin?Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you.Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.Shut up, Lincoler.  It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room. Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too.What? Why -- why me?Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings.  Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken. I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. But -- but --You see, Jerry?  May I show you something?Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure.  Get it? Ooh!Draw me, Jerry. Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind.But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh. You are gonna draw me.Aah! Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there.  It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time -- Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close. There they are!Wait. Something's not right.Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Summer's gonna like me again.Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!Mein journey is over, Morty.  I have something important to tell you.♪ And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪ Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! All right! You did it, Morty. Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.  He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals.  And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty.  Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?Uh, squanchy?Don't squaunch at me.All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now.All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!Boo! You suck, whatever your name is.Boo!Morty, you're the worst, Morty.But these gears just started turnin'.Almost finished, Jerry?Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes. I'm sure it's good enough. Move!Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier.  But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me.No mess. No clean. Beth!Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? What?Well, at least you got all this free stuff. Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while. Ugh! I'm not going to fit.  Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and -- Jerry, just leave the door.It's not a door, Beth. It's debris.I don't care. Just leave it.Yeah. Okay. Ahahahah! "Cape fear"! Hahahaha! "Cape fear"! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from "cape fear".Ugh! Auh! Augh!  Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!Cool. I'm coming, too. Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.What?Nancy told us what a bitch you are. Guys, seriously. Nancy?Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for.Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.  You're so wise.  Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... May I assist you with that?Uh, sure, yeah.  Thanks. Morty, do you know what "wubba lubba dub dub" means?Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, "I am in great pain. Please help me."Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically.No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.Come on, um...Birdperson.Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.My people have another saying-- "gubba nub nub doo rah kah". It means, "whatever lets you sleep at night".Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!Caw!Wow. We are so screwed. Rick, wake up.Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home.Augh. Uh, all -- all right.  All right. Hold -- hold on.  Ahh! So good.Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway.Bring me the thing.What -- what thing? The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps.Rick! That describes everything in your garage! Do you mean this?Summer  for for the win.All right, that should do it.Whoa! What did you do?Uh, s-see for yourself.Whoa!Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that.For how long?I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?Worst movie ever.Dumb.Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen.This has been so much fun.Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say.Don't need to. I have a  new catchphrase.Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?love my grandkids. Aww.Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, "I don't give a fuck".♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ ♪ just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ Roll credits! ♪ Just shake that a-- Roll the credits!

Season one up in your face, motherfucker! Yeah!Revenge.What?!Party!Whoo, baby!Please, stop!Hey, brah!I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?Whatever.Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing. Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad. Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.What is my purpose?Pass the butter.Thank you.Dad, I need a ride to work.Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science.I’m busy.Doing what?Uh, anything else?What is my purpose?You pass butter. Oh my god.Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.Since when did you have a job?Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character.Please don’t.Oh… when did this stop being jamba juice?I’ve just recently opened for business, Mr, um, Goldenfold.You know my name? That’s disarming.I also know you long for female company.You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can’t be filled with jamba juice.This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge: one never pays here. Not with money.Nothing to read into there! Thanks!Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving. Huh.Tell me Rick, what do you desire?Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?What? Sorry?I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?Grandpa Rick!Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science.Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this.  This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.Hahahahaha.Grandpa, go home and drink!Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age.Oh. Ok.You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet. Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade.Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it.Morty, nobody changed the planets.I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006.Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree.You… disagree?That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball.Um, ok, I just have to-Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn!Oh.  Okay good. This is gonna be fun!Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?Um…Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing.Well that’s retarded.What are you guys talking about?Apparently nothing.You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you?No!It’s not.Shut up, Rick.Whoa.I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet.Stay scientific, Jerry.This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price… for everything! Muahahahaha! Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-This serum should counteract the negative effects. Holy cats! Ladies, let’s get out of here.I haven’t learned a thing! Here. You can have this back.You didn’t use it?Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say,  a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.Be quiet!Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling  beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?I find this all quite preposterous!Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo.  That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?Do I need to call the police?Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack.Hey! No! Ugh!Think you’re so great?Stop it!No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!Grandpa Rick, I like working here!You work for the devil!So what?"So what"?!Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye.Whoops.I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but…It’s fine. Summer, you know your grandfather’s right. This store curses people. That’s my business.Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me.Please, call me the devil.I’d rather not, actually.Yes, perhaps not during business hours.I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first!  I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.Dad, what’s your endgame?Ain’t no game, sucka.Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty!Whoa, whoa! Whoa!What the hell?I’m King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction.I’d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.Oh. I…Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he’s creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!Pluto… is a planet.Pluto’s a fucking planet, bitch! Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.If it’s athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might- I’ll take it!But I haven’t even-Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye.Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather’s outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I’ve had since Salem!Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?Is that the vegan place?Yeah, I love their soup.I’m kind of souped out.Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s free, right?Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money.  That was perfect.You pay with the curses, right?Um, I… well-But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?Well, I’m going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?What?Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that gives you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, $8,000,000? See ya at the Olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes.Everything’s deductible.Don’t pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We’re located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down.First… and…Wubba… lubba… dub dub!Wubba lubba dub dub!That’s right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!Diabolical son of a mother-We’re back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?Pluto is a planet. How about that?Wow. I love it!Morty Smith. I’m Scroopy Noopers. I’m a scientist. Can I show you something?Uh… I’d better not. Right now.The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won’t wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof. Um… A party?Is everyone in your family an idiot?For sure me and my dad are. Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure.Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of!Ah! Oh my god!Oh my god.  I wish this desk was lighter! I wish this knot was looser!Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing?  I wish I knew CPR!One, two, three! One, two, three! Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw.Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?I’m the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?You haven’t failed.People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I’m smart and funny.No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name it.I wanna help you.Clever twist.I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated.Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens.Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’That was important to you, wasn’t it?Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.He tried to kill himself.Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up.Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care.Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care.So?So… have fun not caring.I always do.Good.Yeah, it is good. It’s the best.I’m sure it is. Bye.Later!I’m here to pick up my undead cat and child.Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.These are the forms for the employee health plan.Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh.I just got bored. Everybody out.Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project.Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?You told me science wasn’t easy!I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son.Dad, their whole planet is dying!Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.What’s up, Pluto?Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on.My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto.My god! The man’s a genius!Um, excuse me? Morty, what?Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?Good one, dad. Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh.  Hey Beth? Hello?  Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…I am not programmed for friendship.Suit yourself.Hey!  Hey. What’s going on?Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?Whatever.Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!I’m flattered, and humbled.Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that.Your highness! We’ve captured Scroopy Noopers!You animals! Animals!Ooh, look whose little journey’s come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!You can’t kill the truth, father!What?I can see you’re confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.It’s a what?Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That’s what I meant. Knock ‘em dead out there, you. Pluto is… Not a planet.Boo! Ow! It’s not a planet! Hey! It’s not a planet! I’m an idiot, and I love my son!It’s been a long six hours, but we’ve overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 e-nomenon, n33dful.com! Spelled with 3s instead of Es.Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!Okay, that’s it! We just got bought by Google!Yeah!Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make?Haha. ‘We.’  This is my business! Security!Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me?I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg’s balls dropped. I’m the devil, beeyotch! What what!Hey!Hey Morty.Oh! Hey dad!  Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that.Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A. Butter.But-You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!Oh. I uh- I think I underst-You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.I get it! Say no more.I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-I got it! Noted! Goodnight!How’s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?He dumped me.Oof, sorry.Did we learn a lesson here I’m not seeing?Hm, not sure.Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn’t realise how much you valued my approval?No, that’s dumb.Nah, not satisfying.I’ll tell you what though, if it’s satisfaction you’re after, I think I might have an idea.  Uh huh… uh huh… uh huh totally let’s do it!And that’s how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront! Thank you Seattle!Rick? Summer?Stupid mother-Stupid bitch!Stupid motherfucker!Get some!How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?Ugh… Why? Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.We did it!Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha!Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!Yeah bro!Hahaha!Yeah. Last King Christmas last arrived! In the Christmas Christmas!  Mmm... Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.Um, Merry Christmas?  Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?Alive? For your parents?Good one.Hey man!You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity. You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now. Ohhhh...Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. Ho ho ho, everybody.More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.Pearl Harbor.I check in on him once a year and give him a little  medical  evaluation.Aw, Dad... That is so sweet. Yeah, it is... I don't get it.Korea.Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry.  Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.Huh. You think you know a guy.  Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday.  Hey hey!Merry Christmas, son.Oh, hi. Can I help you?Jerry, this is Jacob.  Didn't you get our text message?No.You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma? I wish... But thank you.  So... you're a...friend of the family...? The way we see it, he's a part of the family.Wow!After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing.Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.All three of us....Cool... Eggnog?Now we are talkin’! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?Hi Joyce, Leonard.  Hello there.Merry Christmas, man.Morty! A moment of your time?He's in bad shape, Morty.Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin’ here trying to save the guy's life!  I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin’ on. Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?In Ruben. Ruben... Minnesota?Ruben on the table, Morty!  Look, I-I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything.  Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.W-What proc—Hey Dad, where's Morty?He's busy.Morty, can you hear me? Head North!Rick... Where am I? Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.The entrance to what?Welcome, Morty.  Welcome...  ...to Anatomy Park!It's a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom.  An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?You got a problem with that last one, Morty?Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them.Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.Proceed to the liver.Arriving at ‘Liver’. Ow!Mind the gap.It's really scary in here, Rick.Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster!No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco—  —holism.  That is an animatronic werewolf.Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!Poncho! That's quite enough.Morty, that's Poncho.  This is Roger and Annie. Oh...And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin’ on here?I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked.Exhibits?Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.Watch it.It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.Diseases?!Hey Doc, I have news for ya.  Your living museum is officially a wild safari!Hepatitis A! Run!Oh...  The food goes in your mouth, girl!Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?We can go into detail later, son.Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.  And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.Dad, please, what are you saying?Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard.  And we support you.Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.No no no no.  Jacob is your mother's lover.  I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.Oh... Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble. Happy human holiday, Dad.AHHHHHH!Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system!That's strange...  Air flow is down twenty percent.So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline.W-Well, I guess we better check it out.Hey, wait for me!  Put that back on!If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage. I'll go.  Heheh...Don't be a hero, kid.I'm not. I'm doin’ it because it's fun.  We shouldn't be here.Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work.Ah!It's alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue...  ...keeps them dormant.  Morty! Get down!Whoa!  Whoa!Oh! What are those things?!Tuberculosis, coming in fast! Not faster than a bullet! Ahh! No! Do you know what you've done?!Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!Waaaah! Don't let me die!Just take a deep breath, Ruben.You're not gonna die! What's your name?My name is...  ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis!Oh, great work, Morty.  I'll just cure it, and then—Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor——and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty. It's a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible——please, you gotta treat yourself.Geez, what's that horrible smell?You mean the Panda Express?  Kidding, I-I'm kidding.  The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed.Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.Everybody! Get to the colon!Now I'm takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know...What?Not twelve.Okay.Because he just said I was twelve.Oh. Good for you.Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one. Nnn... It's a road of laughter, a trail of food. It's a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It's a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It's a small, small intestine!It goes on like this for miles... And then we get to the large intestine!Shh.  I hear something. Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.We’re sitting ducks!Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?Yes. Why?Kid! You're a genius! Are you mad?! Everybody! In here!Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation? Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.Christmas drums being played by a boy!Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad.What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.Ugh... Summer! Ethan, what are you doing here?I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!Did you even consider how that might make me feel?How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?! Summer, do you have a boyfriend?Yeah, do you, Summer?I don't know Ethan, do I? Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.What the hell is that?The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!Poncho? What is this in your backpack?That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?Everybody get back!Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you!  You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—AHHHHH!!!Ah! Eh! Get! Get off!  Ahhhh!You guys!It's gonna burst!  Go! Go, go, go!  My foot is stuck!No!This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo—No!Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man?From Summer being a total bitch!Where's the anger coming from?...My brother... took me fishing once...in the bushes...  I can't... I can't!  He made me feel like a girl!  I'm... m-made me a girl!He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are.  She is who she is.  Now you go to her. Brand new.Come here right now!Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan!  I love you!I love you so much.Um...You did it again, cubby. Come here.No! Stop! I hate this!Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you.My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s. You can put your fingers wherever you want…Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? I’m trying to concentrate.Ah, Rick? Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry. I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you.  Right now, you’re my sanest relative.Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite!  Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben's left nipple!We need to get to the left nipple!The body is decaying!  The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the Bone Train.  Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?If it'll get us out of here.How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let's go.Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually....Uh, well...No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on. What the hell is that?E. coli outbreak. Hurry!Oh wait, there is an autopilot.  WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!They're chewing through the doors!Euuuugh!  We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!I'm almost there, Morty!Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that!Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.Oh my god, the track!It's Hepatitis A!The nipple hole...It's beautiful...Aw no!Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?I... think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.Oh. Huh.Where's Dr. Bloom?Sorry Rick... He's dead...Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will—It's raining blood!Oh, shit. find Jerry!Oh god.Jerry! It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about.The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.Dad, can I have my phone back?Sure, sweetie.  Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax.This is nice.Yeah.  I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't.Too bad about Dr. Bloom.  He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.Booyah! Hold your breath!Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.  Puffy vagina.W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!C’mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving.Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.  Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?Loud and clear, Annie.Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—Hey Rick.Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media.Hey everybody.Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin’. So. Pirates of the Pancreas.Yeah, talk to me.Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?”  And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.... Cool. And who pays me?
