Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?What? What kind of monster are you?A competent one.Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.Wait a minute, what?And away we go!Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?Shhh, Morty!...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.Hi, dad.Summer, Morty, are you okay?W-We just missed you a lot.Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?Oh!Uh oh.Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid.Phew...Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.God, I feel terrible.Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.Nuh uh!Yeah huh!Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!You shut up you big... female asshole!I didn't!You didn't what?What's yours?You shut up!Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?What do you mean?Wait, what am I saying?Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?Oh man... I don't feel good.Am I me? I think so.A-am I talking right now?Wait, who said that?Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.What should we do Morty?Let's see if he needs help.What do you mean you're gonna help him.Ugh, I can help too.What's happening Grampa?Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!What do you mean?What? In English?What? English please?Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.But I thought there were infinite timelines.We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.Oh, my God!Are those cats?I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.“Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.Holy shit! What happened?I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.W-what?This is Rum Raisin!It's still alive.Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--It's not an armadillo, asshole!I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.So...Well don't different animals-Require different levels of skill to keep alive?Oh God...Get the deer in the car, Jerry.Yes Beth.This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.Morty 1And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.Or...Or?We “isn't”Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!Huh, what do you know, it's workingOw, ow ouch!Whoa, ow, ow.Oh shit.What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both  all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.Emergency, wounded deer coming in.Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here.I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!Geez...That's odd, this deer's wounded.Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.I mean it's been shot. With a gun.May I help you, sir?Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal.In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.You mean drunk?No.Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God.What?That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!Rick what the hell are you doing?Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!Who?Me!Ahh!Whoa whoa!Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!Who's this now?She normally works on horses.Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!Jesus...Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!Holy shit, now what?Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?Right.Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.Right...I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.You tried to kill yourself!Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.W-what're you doing?Calling myself. Here, listen,  it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.Don't fall for it, it's a bit.Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  we're cool now.Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.Fine I'll just do it myself.If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.You know, geez Rick, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.Oh, my God!It's a monster!It's a monster!Ey, ye ey, quit yellin' quit yellin'.What the fuck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!How did this happen?Shut the fuck up! Oh, damn, I'm from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o' y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second.Ay, damn it, were you tryin' to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?Oh way to go, Rick.Yeah Grampa, way to go.Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!Exactly, because you're being obstinate.Yes, we're back, problem solved.Yes, we're back to our own time.Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again.How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever.Time prison?Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen.You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!Ututututut! You'd better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.Hmm...Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.I guess that's the end of that.We did it...Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I'm talking 'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. Alright man, I'll talk to you later, okay.  You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.Why are you doing this?You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up.What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?You really think I'm that stupid?Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.I cannot argue that.Ah, God, gross and weird!Chris!You killed my gun!Summer, Morty, take off your collars!What? What the hell are you doing?Good question. I suppose the answer isOh, no, what are you doin'?Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago.Ow, I'm defeated...Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.Where are we going?One last stop.Where's the helicopter?There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.But the top deer surgeon...I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.I need five minutes.Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.Yes, oh, yes, yes!Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.Yeah.But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.Hey guys, we're home.Morty & SummerUm, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.I'm gonna pee my pants.Doesn't feel so good, does it?No it doesn't. It hurts.I'm gonna pee-hee-hee.Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?Hey man, when the hell were you?I told you past the dinosaurs.Come on, man, it's this way...There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop.Yeah, that's him. Hey, man, remember me?  I got something for your ass! You don't mess with time! You don't fuck with time, motherfucker!The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.Jerry, get a job.Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.Gross, what is that thing?Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.Oh, okay... I squanch my family.What? I do, I squanch my family.Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.Uhh, where?The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school?It’s not God, Summer.She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!Shut up, Jerry.Ok…Dad, what do you know about this?Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I’m Morty’s math teacher. I’m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.How is praying going to help?Ma’am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let’s be rational! I’ll see you at God’s house!Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.Hey.I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.How do you know about that?For God’s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps.What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?Dear God.Good luck, Mr. President.Sanchez! Are you a musician?I dabble, Mr. President.Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky.Ah, di di di di.  Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this  can beat that… what have you done for me lately?  So if you wanna excuse me, I’m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather!  Outta my way!Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!Rick, are you really a musician?Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?Me!Yeah, not with that attitude.B-b-but we don’t have a song!Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!Oh man, ok, all right, um…Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwiftyGet… schwifty? What the hell is that?It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what.Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. BulldopsMr. Bulldops?Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in hereListen! The storm is stopping!Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time todayPlease be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.No, I’m… I’m just saying, we don’t know if there’s a cause-effect relationship --Oh, God, what’s going on now?What the hell happened?I think planet Earth has just been transported.The head has left and sent its children!Holy CRAP!Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.DISQUALIFIED!There’s one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.Like we’re not already under enough pressure!Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!Genius happens in the moment, Morty.Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?What?!Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!I’ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.And what’s your plan, General?We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!We should pack up and leave town now.I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?Yeah, sure. Wait, what??I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.Dinner sounds nice.Father, can we please go to the Ascension?Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies!  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he’s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He’s like, “I’m ready!”Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway.Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!What?!Damn. You didn’t tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.That’s it!Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.Nooooo!Ahhhh, shit!Ah, shit.Ahhh, shit.And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!Yeah.Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It’s 6 p.m., so if you’re a parent, you’re now entitled to adoration from your children.I’m going to start dinner!I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.She’s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew…That’s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.That’s wonderful, Summer!We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night.Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!Morty.Birdperson?You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing.Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs.Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can’t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I’m sayin’?Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.Pfff. I ain’t worried about no Earth blowin’ up, man.What? Why not?Yo, this is why.What the fuck? You can turn into ice?My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick.Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to “get schwifty.”Oh, for God’s sake, that’s enough.What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I’m the goddamn President of the United fuckin’ States!I’m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth’s performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!Wait, wait, wait, why-why --I believe I can access the history of Rick’s gun and help you get back to him.But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.Don’t be gross, Tammy.Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.What’s that? Who’s that baby?Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?That was Chunky Tunk with “Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp.” Up next, planet Earth!Oh God! We’re up?!?!Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world.The world?Headism is a hit. We’re taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our church’s “Head” of Advertising.You… would?Beth, we’d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to “Head” of Medicine.That’s my dream! That’s my dream.Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t.Absolutely not.I’m sorry?We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become.We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!Please don’t do this, please don’t do this! Summer!Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts.You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello?  He’s blocked me out.Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!It won’t matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The General’s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth’s song!Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?Can the Pope’s dick fit through a donut?Uhhh, I’m not sure?Exactly!SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.Headward free now to rise!Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!I’m really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.I’m sure that has… that has nothing to do with this.The heads are displeased!Morty!The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!Just launch the missiles!BOO! NOT COOL!I’m the only one that speaks to the heads!DISQUALIFIED!The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!That’s right, it’s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I’d like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.What do you say, Rick?I say…  Let’s do it!All right!Ohhhh yeahhhh!Come on, here we go!Ohhhh yeahhhh!Say it with me!Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!Did he just say “musical reality show”?Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!We should go get him.I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty.Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we’ll deny it and probably worse.Understood.DIIIIEEEE!!!!Why didn’t he turn into a snake?Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.I love this man!Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father.I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!Woahh!ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.Not anymore.You're overreacting!Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.Is he going to die?What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?Go in the waiting room, Dad.Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.A sequel.Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry.Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?Where am I?Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you.My goodness.I see-WAIT! What?It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call "your balls". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!Yeah, but, I mean-Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?Morty let's-let's see what else is on.Okay.Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?Is that something we should be concerned about?Just stay away from the coffee machine.In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's.And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.Jan-Michael Vincent's are used up.Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?Nope.This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16.That's Jan-Michaels.Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.All right, Morty you've done it!So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here.Got it.Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.Smith family?Yes?I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.WHAT!?!Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog.I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean.Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first.There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?Hundreds of billions.I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.Beth, can we talk about this privately?You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, "I prefer to keep my penis."But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets?Aw shoot, it was supposed to be a surprise! I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation!Steve, you're so sweet!Thanks Uncle Steve!Best uncle ever!Look out world, the Smith family is goin' to Paris! Yeah! Awesome!Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash.Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.I, you know what, I-You're gonna land on your feet Jer. Some company out there's gonna thank they're lucky stars they hired my little brother.Who the fuck are you?My goofy brother Steve. He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?Hey someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right? What the hell, Rick? What the hell?Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve." That is an alien parasite.But I've known him my whole life!No, you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.Steve wasn't real?He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.Someone?Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.Ooh wee, whatever you want Rick! We're here to help!Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!Can't afford to chance it.Dad, why does our house have blast shields?Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After the Hulk musical?Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong.I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did.Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that.Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. Somebody call for repairs?Yay! Cousin Nicky!It's me, Cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air.Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.I hear you, Morty. Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- "we're walkin' here!" Nicky! Oh!  What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.But how did you know it was Nicky?I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?Well, of course it happened.Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.I'm comfortable being called a Nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?  Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill America! Mr. Beauregard!After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.Yeah! Oh, thank god!Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school.Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler.  dare to dream.Wait.And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. No! Don't flashback!You're just gonna make more swelling.Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department.You know they won't come here anymore. Marmalade is served. I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine. Take that!We're trying to sleep.I don't want to go to the dance alone.Then perhaps, you shouldn't.Aww. Mr. Beauregard.Shall we, master Morty?We shall.Oh, wait, don't leave without letting Photography Raptor take a picture.  Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.You sure about that, Rick?Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number.All right, there's six of us,  and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?Right here, Rick! Use me!Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!  Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? That's it. Photos. Hard evidence.  You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole.Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine.All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.  What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're Mormon or dying.I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.Summer!Tinkles! It's past my bedtime. Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!Summer, we're trying to sleep.It was Tinkles! Tinkes?That is su--  -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to –Hi, everybody. I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends. See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I.I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. Aah! Grandpa Rick! Hold still, "Summer."Rick, that is my daughter.Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue?Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?Rick, you love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai!Remember it, Rick?Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue.You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.You're good at it, Rick.Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, "Cuisine" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from "Cuisine."  Yeah. Is that what it's called? "Cuisine"?Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grill master, Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Wait.  Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?Yeah.Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition "Zelda" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.Don't overreact, Rick.Sleepy Gary, a word?Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster.Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then...Jerry, just say it.Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation?They're filming that new Star Wars movie down the coast. Should we check it out?Sure. Why not?Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.I'd like that.What are we doing?I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this.Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house.That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?Uh, no thank --  Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a -- No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!  Give it back!Yeah!  Frankenstein! Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai.Hai!I saved Ghost In A Jar's life in Vietnam.Boo rah!And Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on? Too many.Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.That don't make no sense!Giraffe: Or maybe, there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other.Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!  yeah! Say that all the time. That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.And don't forget his incredibly vague back story.Beth, I'm your father!Oh, are you, dad? Are you?Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?In your face!Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!Oh -- oh, yeah?Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherfucker! Pull the fucking trigger!Oh, wow. Baby Wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. What the hell?I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!Holy crap, Morty, you're right.Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time?  Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming.Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life.The jig is up!  get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah!   Oh, shit!Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?Why am I always your go-to?Never go in my room again.I didn't!She's real. She's my bitch of a sister.Nice.Mom, are you driving me to --Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?Oh, my god. Are you drunk?  What're you, my life coach?Your what?Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom!Sweetheart, are you okay? I didn't mean to --I'm gonna have a bruise! It's picture day!It's not, don't overreact. I can clean it up. I want the police to take me!Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem.Thank you, sweetie.Beth, Beth, please!I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys.      Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.Rick, I'm Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can't kill me.You're right.  Kill Pencilvester.Summer, I've always loved you!Yep.    Oh, my god!I-I-I thought you went to a concert!We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!You're not the victim here!I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!Aaaaaah!Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren't going to shoot me? I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?Oh, I-I get it. It's a play on "the butler did it."Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.  You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.Don't worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there's a -- No. No! Send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.Whoa. What the hell?Look out for that homeless guy!Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!There isn't time! Just run! Get out here and help me!They say you shouldn't do that! Just run!Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You're real. I'm a parasite!Yeah, but you're real.Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.Me, too.From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family.At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Rikki tikki tavi!Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop? Huh. I-is -- is something wrong, Beth?No, Beth!Oh, fuck.Wait, but I --Oh, Beth! Why?!I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend.Why?Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.I-I thought --Keep breathing!Oh, god. What's happening?Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep!Is -- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die?Oh, geez! Oh, my god!Why would you do this? Beth. It's not supposed to hurt. I-I thought...  Ooh, whee.Oh, he -- he's looking a lot better.Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.Is, um, is he mad at me?He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent of not being mad.Can he have visitors?He'd like to be alone. He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave.  And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise.I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13Yeah, I'm pretty jealous.Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!Shut up! W-whoa!We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!Oh great.Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside.Uhm. Go inside what?The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y.Wait! You can't leave me here!You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe.Keep. Summer. Safe.Egh, wonderful.Hey, excuse me, hello?Uhmm...What you think you're better than me? Nobody's better than me! Ey! ey!Agh! Aghaaaa!Keep. Summer. Safe.Hey man, what the hell! That was my daughter's paediatrician! Uagha!No! Stop, don't kill him!Confirmed.Uaghuu. Ugh. Uh. Oh God! I can't feel my legs! Help! He-elp!Summer is safe.I don't feel safe.Confirmed.Oh God help me! Help me! help me please! You can help me.Oh man. Where are we Rick?Morty, remember eight seconds ago when -burp- when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here?Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, "Go inside what?" And I said, "The battery"? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, "Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is."All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls.Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing?W-w-w-whoa, people? It's time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something.Whoa!Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out.I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out.You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens.What? Why?Obviously  you really  know nothing about car repair.Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.Greetings!Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means "Peace among worlds." How hilarious is that?Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.Rick, our alien friend.Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power.That's correct.  We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete.  I would love to see it. you.What did you say to me?!" you." Y-you told me it means "much obliged".Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.No, no, no. Blow me.Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something.Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien...Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people.Ohhhh, snap!Listen to me, you arrogant little-- R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse. Dumb  name.Excuse me? Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?This isn't a  chocolate factory. I don't have time.Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go.Whoa-oh!Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes.I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool.What?!Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery.No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then-- Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.Rick, a word?What the hell was that?I know. "Eek barba dirkle"? That's a pretty  up "ooh-la-la".No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. Wh-wh-why are you making that face? Holy Shit!It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world. You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien.Places, please. We're about to land. Too fast.Law enforcement converging on location. Keep Summer safe.No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody! Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force. Yes.Processing.Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!Scanning assailants.  Psychological option detected.  Gestating."Gestating"?Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!Incoming!We got a device!Bomb! Bomb!Daddy?Oh, my God.  Hunter?Daddy?What the hell? Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! H-h-hunter?Daddy.Hunter!  Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter. Oh, my boy. My boy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault. I'm sorry.Daddy, leave the car alone.W-w-w-what? Leave the car alone.Hunter?Don't--Oh, my God.Stay here, Hunter! No!  God, no! Hunter!All of you have loved ones. All can be returned. All can be taken away. Please step away from the vehicle. Keep Summer safe.And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.Hey, uh, let me ask you something.Yes?Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?All of them. That's their job.Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?How do you know about that? It's top secret.So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.  Crank it. I told them this means "Peace among worlds". How hilarious is that?Re-really funny, Zeep.Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you.It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is--You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. It's show time.You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically-- This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves. Told you, Zeep.Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money.That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.What? Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?Microverse!Uh, teenyverse.Ugh! You b*st*rd!Much obliged.What the hell is happening?This is healthy, trust me.You're my battery, mother.  That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a  lobster tank! It's whack!Are they not really aliens?Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.I made you! Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!Teenyverse.Come on, come on, come on.Pterodactyl! Asshole! When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. That's what you used my universe for? To run your car?Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!You crafty son of a--Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!I didn't ask to be born!All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this.Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!Go, go, go!Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now?I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it.Correct.You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that. Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy.You know you're kind of a dick, right?My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff. That's you. That's how you talk.Hey, that's my deer!Aaaaaaah!Raah!I hope your God is as big a dick as you.My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here?You're here because you created someone smarter than you.Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots.Kalo kada sha la.Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up.We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.That is pretty gay.You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you.This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home.No can do, Morty. I just can't.I just don't see how I can--Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out.You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! 10, 9...All right, not bad.I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.If this works, drinks are on me.If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic.Opium addict.All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the  worst! Your gods are a lie!  you,  nature, and  trees!Yes! You did it! Yes!Hey, uh, how about that drink?Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.Is our wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.You know how long a second can take in a microverse?Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic!Morty, hop on my back.Why?Go, go  Sanchez ski shoes.Aaaaaah!...Eight...Aaaah! Oof!Hold still. Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast.Aaaah! Holy--You monster!Whoa. Bad tour....seven...Hey, you got to sign out. Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!If that were really true, then...I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with--Uh, no.You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it.What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car.What?!A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.Oh, my God!Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine....six...Hey, Zeep.Huh?Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.Aaah!We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe.Excuse me?...five--Sir?Holy hell.Sir!Hold you fire!What's going on?I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.What do we do about the space car?Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?  Not a bad trade for spider peace. .All right, that's it. Move out! I love this spider!Summer is safe.All right, I get it.Rick!Don't do it.You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. Aah!Unh!Class dismissed.Geez.You all right?Uh-huh!What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see.Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it.Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. Peace among worlds, Rick.Jesus.Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go.Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about.This is why we do what we do.Uh-huh.Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.What the fuck did you do, Summer?!It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it!Don't blame my ship!It melted a child!My ship doesn't do anything...It killed it itself!...unless it's told to do something!We almost died!I don't want to hear it, Summer!Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either.Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.Cool. See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on.  Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool.  Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space? WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!What are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s learning to drive.I guess I remember that.  Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917. Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure!Yep.This is where we’re going?Nope.  This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.Well look at this fella.  Aren’t you handsome?Thank you! I’m Jerry.  Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?Oh, they’ll be back soon.What?I don’t know how this works!Help me!What the hell?I know, right? Oh, what the hell?I know, right? Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich.Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off. Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.Okay, wait here.I wanna come with.Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s  business stuff.What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.Ah, crap.  Hey, what’s up?Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D’you have the weapon?Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.Ugh.  Here, now go away. Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can’t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered,  please give me a call. I’m very discrete—Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!…You sell weapons to killers for money?Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?Uh, what?An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.  Here, check this out.Ah!Roy, what’s wrong?I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.It’s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don’t want you missing school on Monday. I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.  Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.Spiraling perfectly, it’s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20!  Now he’s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!I just think it’s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly.I’m not…ready to die… You’re not going to.Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy. Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase. W… Where’s my wife?Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store. Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid!  This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.Well of course! Right through that tube.  Unbelievable. You’re doing great! I know how to crawl in a tube.  Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks…  Whoooooaaaa!Marco?  Marco?Come find me.Marco? You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized?How so?Jerry!Beeeth.Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!I love you, Jerry!Aw… Beth…Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?Oh! Yes! Definitely!First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!The factory tint setting is always too high! Out of my way!The factory tint setting is always too high!Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below. All out of off-white Persians…  Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?!  Drop the gun!You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!I guess that makes two of us. What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!You saved my life!What?Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.Morty, don’t do it.  Morty…  Morty, you idiot!Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty. Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh…Fart.No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away!More are coming.Screw this. I’m out.Oooh…! Come on, come on!Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire! Oh no no no!Open fire!Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker!  Move!Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?More are coming.Rick!Yeah, yeah. Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire— So I’ve heard. Just fix it.  I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile.  Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.You do understand I’m telepathic, right?I’m being polite.Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs!Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call “get out of my head, Fart, I know you’re in here, la la la la—” No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick. Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.I could not agree more. The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space  / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby— Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low! Duck, duck, birdie?  Very funny!Here comes another funny…Hahaha! Oh, this place is great.I almost wish I could stay longer than one day. You just might.W-What do you mean?These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back.  …They live here now.Uuuum…No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives  reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.Son of a…  Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.  That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it. Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us!  Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead…  I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One.Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!Friend? Do you even know my real name? It’s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ‘Gearhead’ is like calling a Chinese person ‘Asia-face.’No, not twigs!Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.Nobody move!Oh my god.Are those…?Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?I did the right thing, Rick!Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.You did that!Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty. I can’t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw.Ante up.You know what?  Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys.  I say we escape.If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.You think we’re kept here against our will? That would be illegal.But… If you can leave, then why are you still here?Same reason as you.  …We’re Jerrys.I’m leaving.Okay then, that was always allowed.Morty, take the wheel!Whoa, whoa!Whoa!Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?!  Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.Um, Rick!Shit. Well, I guess this is it.Morty, crack the window.I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.Well… He’d probably like to have me to himself, that’s how friends are.Or does he want her to himself?The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. My life is a fucking joke.Goodbye, moonmen. / You say, goodbye, moonmen.Goodbye, moonmen…  Alright, let’s proceed.Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’? Are you done?I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done.  Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!Ga-ga blahg blahg?Um… Earth, please?Um… Is this… Do I pay?Agah blahg-blah! Sorry!Hmm. Hmm…  Agh! Agah blahg blahg?I don’t… Agah blahg!What do you want? Agah blahg blah—Oh!  Ahahaaaahhhhh…. Uhhh… Huhhh….  Oooh! Hey, are you the one that left?I get it. It’s… uh… a hassle out there. Right? Who needs that? Right? Not me.Oh-ho, not us!Uh… Who are you?Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleishman.  Infinite timelines! In some of them Beth remarries.…Geez…Don’t worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there’s no replacing you. Hey, you wanna give us a hand with this?  We’re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. I-I-I don’t—It’s very difficult.Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input?I tried that, but there’s two different colors.Uh… There’s two different colors.The wormhole is seventy of what you call ‘meters’ what you call ‘north’ of what you call ‘here.’Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.I’m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I’m really sorry your name became Fart.I will be back soon, Morty. Really?After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.Um… Cleansing…?Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice.  You haven’t changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty. Um… Before you go… Could you sing a… C-Could you sing for me again?Yes, Morty.  Cosmos without hatred / Blinding stars of cosmic light / Quasars shine through endless night / And everything is one in the beauty / And now we say goodby—Morty… Why… Why?Goodbye.So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know?  You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit. What?! Rick! No, you can’t!Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.No, no, Rick! You don’t understand!Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.Hey.  Hey bro. How many people was your Morty responsible for killing today?None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain’t that right homie?Darn right bro! Roy rules!Haha! Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick.Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?I’d like that. Hey, wait, do you have 5126?Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.Uh, that’s a Blips and Chitz ticket.What?!Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.Uh… W-wait, what?Alright, come on, Jerry.Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz!  We got, uh… one game! We got a whole bunch of games here! Uh, we got chabos and flobos and you can shoot things! Get on over here and play the games! Use your Flurbos to get tickets! Roy 2 just got here! G-Get over here at Ch… Chips and Chitz!It’s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial! Love. Connection. Experience.Yeah Morty Come together. With love. connection, experience! It's my favourite songHahahahaha, yeahOh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!You're excited about that?The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!Whoa!One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!Seems like something terrible happened here.Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.Uh, what's that?This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.That's horrible!I hear you man, cops are racist.Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of  entity! It absorbed the minds of our people!We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It.And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.Hey! No, no- uurgh!Called it.Hello Rick. Long time no see.Unity!?Rick?Grandpa?Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?After we broke up, I spend some time wandering through space,then I found this world,where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.You mean stealing peoples’ bodies?Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.Ugh.Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?You're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; I've never been good at disappointing Rick.Well now I'm going to barf. Come on Morty.Jerry, what are you- what are you doing in here?I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ‘cause our weeds are wack, yo.But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.I can't?Well, he doesn't like it.What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house?What is that supposed to mean?Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! He's playing you, shorty.Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect!Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up.What the hell was that? I don't know, let's just leave!That is a hatch! Your father put a hatch in my garage!You don't know it was him!  Anyway, we’re not supposed to be in here!Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there.World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next?After I become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the Galactic Federation.Oh, goody.From there I'll have access to countless planets and species.One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god. I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?Recreational substances were phased out here. There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one.Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. People... change.Especially when I change them. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but... I’ve grown.Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?Hm, why is that I wonder?Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.Yes Rick! Yes! Yes!Oh yeah!Yes! Yes!Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!Look at ‘em go! So coordinated! What’s your problem? They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people's’ bodies are being used! They're a planet of puppets!I can hear you.Ugh!Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else.Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?No, we don't want your dumb balloons. We’re bored. Take us back to Rick.Now's... not a good time.Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!Go son go! Go son go! Go son go!Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing?Oh, you know my dad. Once he puts his mind to something...You're spinning this to his credit?I'm going down there.Jerry!Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?Okay, you're just making stuff up now.Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh Rick, it was so bad.What's this ‘was’ stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!Oh damn.Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors.It's a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7. Our planet's maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources.  So be nice!Unity.  Is it a... bad time? Are all... present lifeforms... assimilated?Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick.Rick... Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you.All bad I hope. Whoa, Jesus Christ!Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well.Our alliance is beneficial. When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it's only ... be-because...Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?Oh... Rick, I- I shouldn't...Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town! It- it's for old time's sake.Uh... Okay, what the hell! We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but...Aww, old man Rick can't party with the whole planet?I can do whatever you do and more, baby.Hrmm...You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill.Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal-Goddamn it, stop.Wake up people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster!I can hear you.Yeah! So you keep saying!Summer!Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there!Why do you hate me, Summer?I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to......Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free!Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender....Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself.This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she's a marine biologist.Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be... you know, life.I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now phisosophers.Oh, phi- phisosophers?Philophiluh... phiphophibup...Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?I'm feeling... urk!Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!I'm fine!Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I’ve met who really sees the big picture.You got that right. But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know.I can let go! Hey, look! You see that town across the river? Watch this.Whoa!Ha ha! Woot!Whoa! That's not what I meant! It's okay! It's okay, I evacuated! I evacuated the town, look!Hey! Right here! We’re fine! Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty.Aah!Unity, what's happening?Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?Gross, no!I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity.Do... all of you remember who you are?...Yeah. My name is Ron Benson. I'm... an electrical engineer. Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race! Okay, that's good! Uh... Don't focus too much on the last part, but...I'm Daryll Jefferson. I'm a landscaper. And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!  The cone-nipple people will rule this world!You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!What'd you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?Race war!Why are you fighting? Can't you see you're all the same?Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.I didn't start it! They're the racists! I... I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!Hey wait, what race are you guys? We’re neither! S-see?Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples.Hey! These two freaks have no race!Oh, there's no place like home! There's no place like home! Remember, Summer?Oh...From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?O-oh, yes, yes yes...All the tiny people?Dorothy, take us away! Take us away!Hello Summer. Hello Morty.It's okay! You're safe now.U-Unity?Yes.Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of... a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing.Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong! I'm having fun with your grandpa! Lost a little control. Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be... running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! It's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!Um... should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...?No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk! Wooohoooo!Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone!Jerry, stop! Please, okay, we weren't even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this-Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic!Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! It's a monster! He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet!Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He's probably harvesting this creature's organs!He's probably racing to cure its space aids!He's going to eat it!He's protecting it!Shut up!Unity! This place is a mess!Oh, it's cool! The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.  Oh my god! I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. Oh, I'll never make it! Ah, I'll push it to next week.Unity, could you get Rick out here please?He's... unavailable! He's-Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now.I don't think he wants to be- Grandpa Rick! Rick! Rick! I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!What the hell... is your problem?Grandpa, we need to go home! Now!Fine, geez!See ya!Uh, Rick? I think we should all go.Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here.Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you!Oh my god  you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it!What?This isn't healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?You and Unity are like... like... leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other!Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?I'm just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax.Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up.In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We’re... really just having a good time. Karen?Thanks, Todd. Up next: Are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We'll tell you how you can really know for sure!I think you two are a little outnumbered.Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us... because you love us?What? Dumb. Bye.But Rick, Summer's just-Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here... uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike.Take care of yourself, Unity.I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?You're the worst!No! You're the worst! You don't support this family!All you care about is yourself!You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally...You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos......but you're unsupportable! Because it's never enough, Jerry!...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!It will never be enough support to satisfy you! And you don't even know what it's like...Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him!...to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling...And why? Because you're the child, Beth. You, not me, you!Aaah!Oh my god!Aah!Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I'd laugh but I'm biologically incapable, that's how alien I am! And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck?!? So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I'm sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam, out!You know what? I'm taking this.How do you- what is this?Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever.Aaah!  Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ‘em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ‘em all do it on the table! I can’t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha!  Alright, I’m bored.Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? I feel bad that they-Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?Never.Never! Back in a flash.Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!Hey Une! You got any more-Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but... it clearly means I have a problem with myself.I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete.But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S. I don't know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. You might want to get checked.Hey.Dad...  I... um... Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair... and your alien prisoner. And... he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.Okay....Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?No. It's your house.Grandpa Rick! What happened... with Unity?Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It's not cool. Fun's fun but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.Unity! Unity! Unity!How can I assist you?I wanna talk to  Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you.I know your game, Beta-7, I’ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!You are classified as a hostile entity.Well, you're just loving this, mother f- this isn't gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity's not into other hiveminds! It's gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I'm going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!Weapons systems engaged.Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems.Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie.We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch!"They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy, they just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful, then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?""Never."Unity's Note
