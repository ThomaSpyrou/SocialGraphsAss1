Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.You got it.Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?Man, I told the money bugs. I said, "You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer.Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum.Shoney's.Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.Relaxed enough?I admire you, Rick--When I--Rick, here's--I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do.Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.You spoil us, Conroy.Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!Ooh!Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.Yeah, well, tough titties.Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.Fine, but I'm driving.Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!You're right!What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!Where are we going?To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film "Mulan," where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.Okay. All right, all right.Is that--Me. I used to wear blue pants.When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?I didn't. I did.What?Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.And how are you gonna do that?I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-What is this place? And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?That's my sister. This used to be my home.Sounds lonely.Eh, pass.A different kind of Rick, I guess.Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage.Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this.These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so." So, uh--What are you doing with that?!No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.He's in prison.Summer.He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.Boo-yah!Boo-nah?Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt.Nooooooo!Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie?Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it.Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?Nope, they cannot.Why not?Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!A city of Grandpas?It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.Morty?What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.Grandpa Rick!Duh!You're alive!Rick!Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.That's enough, Rick.What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!R-Rick?Why not shoot through her?20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.What the fuck?Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.Because you love her!Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.I hate you!Not an issue, sweetie.That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!Ha!Aww.The point is he thought I was going to.I totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Morty.Morty, you fucking idiot!You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.Who's stupid now, bitch?!Morty, we just got him back!That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.What?! What happened?Oldest Rick trick in the book."Fake gun, shoot me in standoff." Brilliant.Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.Can't we just portal home?Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?Destroying the  galactic government.Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!Jerry, what the hell is happening?!The galactic government collapsed.Are you okay?Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.Guess who dismantled the government?Please don't leave me again.I never will, baby.I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.No, you're right. Where's the vodka?Beth, it's him or me!Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.For everybody.For everybody.I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.Oh, geez.He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.Oh, fuck.I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -Oh, man.- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -Oh, man.- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -You're gonna deny it.- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -Oh.- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that "Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -What are you talking about?- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.Szechuan?That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.McNuggets?I want that "Mulan" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.What the hell?If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.What are you talking about, Rick?That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.What are you talking about?!Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.What is that?!For 97 more years, Morty!What are you talking about?!I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!I am Phoenixperson.Morty.Rick?Morty!Rick?Hey, Mooorty!Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!Morty?Rick? W-where are you?On my work bench, Morty.Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?Flip the pickle over.What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.And?"And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?Was it?Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened beforeAre you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.Well, can you move? Can you fly?I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.All right, well, do pickles live forever or --Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.Where are you guys going?We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?Morty!It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never "find a way" to "get out of" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?Can't argue with that.Great. We'll see you later.Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!Oh, crap, that sun is bright.Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.Oh, God, moisture.Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!Oh! Oh!Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!Come on. That's it.Come get this delicious brine.Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!Yes!How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?Temporarily. By order of the school.Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?We... have never... eaten poop.Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in.I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --He turned himself into a pickle.Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?What? No, what kind of question is that?The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?Wow. Ugh.I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.Oh, he did not!Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.Do you really not see what's happening here?Tell me.Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.Fuck you.Fuck both of you, too.By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special.God damn it, I love myself.Pickle Riiick!Get that parkour. Get that parkour!Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit.Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?What is it?Where is it?We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.Your mere presence in this building violates international law.You should know those men killed themselves.And how is that?They didn't  let me out.Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!Uh, is this not a good time or...?Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"That'd be a lucky break for you.Ah....because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.He's just a pickle!He's not the only one.Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.I never said I was angry at you.That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say "I'm angry at mommy" out loud.Oh, my God!It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.You admire him for that.It's better than making your problems other people's problems.Oh, come on!You should know that isn't original.There's nothing I won't do to see her again.Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.Jaguar couldn't make it.Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building.No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination.Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.Jaguar's daughter is dead.Huh, so you're a liar.Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.I don't think so. See you soon.Is the helicopter here?Tell them we were robbed.Farewell, Solen'ya.Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.Good. Summer, you go.I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.Good job. Morty, do you have an "I" statement?I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?Ugh.You must be Rick.Mm-hmm.I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.By changing you from a pickle to a human.Yes.Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?So I wouldn't have to come here.Why didn't you want to come here?Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.Are we gonna go back?Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.Eh.Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.Weird breed.Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.Absolutely.I, I liked her.So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?Yeah, either one. Either one.You'll never get away with this, Concerto.This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!Jaguar!Who? Who was that, Rick?That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.Then why aren't we killing them?!Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep.God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.Vindicators, Worldender is back.....and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on...My balls.Rick!...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base.Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.Rick, stop!Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there.Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.Happy hour.Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Morty, right?Whoa, yeah!I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?Did he say "three for three"?Did he say he never forgets a kid?You mean "two for two", right, Vance?Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?I sense... insecurity.Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.We weren't here "last time", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts".Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.Yeah, but not heroes.Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.Oh, God.Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea.Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission.Vindicators, prepare for arrival.Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I'm afraid we need to make a little change.I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us? Disgraceful.I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good.Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs.Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob?Security drones, inbound.Star Mother, grant me your wrath!All aboard!Aah!  Gun turret.Are you all right?Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.Someone wake up Sanchez.Ugh! Oh, Christ...Rick, you're up.Barely.Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?Uh-huh.Uh, my God, that's better.RICK!Hey, I can't help if I can't see.I could've just used a ghost train.Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!Man, fuck you.Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?Get it yourself.Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?Just focus on the mission, all right?Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here.What the FUCK?!It's Worldender! What happened to him?I sense his life force is fading.Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!He's right. This is far from over.Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.Shit.I sense the presence of a greater evil.Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know...Rick? What's going on, buddy?Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours....So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game.Rick, is-is this a "Saw" thing? Are you seriously "Saw"-ing the Vindicators?Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  "Sawwww".Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die.Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.Why are you acting like that's not you?!What part of "blackout" don't you understand? I thought you drank?Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!Vance, stay calm...Oh, so you're the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!Okay, ouch, but...Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.Guys!  I've figured it out.Congrats! You did it-- it!It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we'll deal with the two of you.The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.That's not the issue, Rick!Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.Crocubot, don't!Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.Goddammit!Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?Nothing!Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!W-Wait, huh?Doomnomitron was hiding here! He's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!Oh, o-okay. This again?You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was!If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...Do not threaten her!Congrats, you did it!What the hell is Is-ra-el?I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.I have no stake in this.I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you.Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.Morty, how many of these...?Too many, Rick! Too many!Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.That's a three-pointer!Nice shot.Thank you.You two make quite a team.We all do.Yeah, I guess.That's a three-pointer!But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.I mean, really unspoken. Like, "let's-not-tell-my-husband" unspoken.We aren't married anymore, Alan.Sure, but were we married when you two were "stranded" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!That's a three-pointer!Where the fuck is the lead wire?!You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.Holy shit. You're jealous.YES! Is that what you want to hear?!Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!That's a three-pointer!Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.WHAT?!I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And yes, he was better than you!Yeah?One million times better!ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!STOP!Oof! Didn't see that comin'.Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.All of them.O-kayyy...Congrats, you did it!All right, buy now, I've been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert.I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!I could--It could be Morty.What?Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying "Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."That is a... really specific guess.Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.But you're betting our lives on it.I'll cover that bet. I get it.Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...Oh, shit.Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other......but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, "Oh, the Vindicators are so cool." I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob....Motherfucker!You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?Shut up.I sense this means we are not drying.Not all of us.Sweetheart?Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good.Greater good?!Titty-Bean?It's like you said, MortyNever said that!It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!Yeah, I feel safer already.No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.Right?Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man.When did it get so complicated?Who knows? But we can make it simple again.You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave either.Goodbye, my love.Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!Silence! I'm going to enjoy this...Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out thereLook at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.Rick, Supernova's getting away!Ah, who cares?But.. she was trying to kill us!Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.Shut up, Summer.Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!Oh, for fuck’s sake.What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.They tried to murder him first.Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.Every day.You don’t have to be a dick.Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.Man. Glad I’m not one of them!Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, there’s a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating.His name is Simple Rick, but he’s no dummy.He realized long ago that the greatest thing he’d ever create was his daughter.We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Rick’s mind.And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick’s Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick’s.We had a good run, sir, but I think it’s time to pull out of the race.I feel pretty confident about tonight’s debate.You shouldn’t, sir. You should be terrified.Maybe you should find a little faith, young man.You don’t pay me to have faith! And we’re the same age!Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookieMortys are human!Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin’ animal!WHOA!!The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.That’s pretty harsh, sir.So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.Look, I’m just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys “animals”.Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training.Well, I’m glad to know there’s more like me.Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?Fifth and ? That’s Mortytown.Unit 7 responding."Good idea, Rick.""This is a great adventure.""I love being your new Morty."Farty!Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had?Five…I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty?Anything’s possible, Tall Morty. Ugh…Guess we won’t be seein’ each other after this, huh?I say we make our last day count. I say… we go to the Wishing Portal.That’s a myth.If we’re not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown.I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken.Okay, fine. I’m in.Me too.I-I thought I saw a fly.No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin’ amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin’.Yeah, make sure you get that down.Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?Lemme turn over a few rocks.Aw geez, hey, what’s goin’ on, fellas?Aw geez, man, nothin’ man, we’re just hangin’ out and stuff.I hear that, ah geez, I guess I’m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno.Ah geez man, that sucks that your Rick’s makin’ you do that.He’s not my Rick. He’s my partner. Aw, geez.Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick.CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!Hey man! C’mon, aw geez!WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!It was the Mortytown Locos, man! The Mortytown Locos!Do you realize how many codes you just violated?Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin’ stuff? Get in the fucking car.Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over.I don’t see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go.I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we’re all the same because they’re threatened by what makes us unique.I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we’re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss’s salary, even though they’re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel’s problem isn’t homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks.The Citadel’s problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel’s debt.Holy shit.But I’ve got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message… from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don’tHoly shit.  I don’t believe it! I-I can’t believe it!I know.  That’s why you’re fired.Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies! Don’t you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!Yes?Gosh. We moved around so much it’s hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.I hope they see me as their Morty.Another, please, with less water.I guess I shoulda had more faith.What’s this?Hands in the air!You guys doin’ a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?Is this what I think it is?Bootleg portal fluid.Guess his math was off. Search the place.It’s okay, Morty.Jesus!He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty.Shh, it’s okay, you’re okay.You were right…  Everything I learned in the academy was--It doesn’t matter.  Nothing’s wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.Why is there a crib in here?Just somethin’ they do to make you feel bad.Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.What happened?Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.Almost... got it...I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere!Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.You wanna know why?  Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored?Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves.Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.Hey there. How you doing? Great to meet you.That doesn't sound like Rick work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?This is just like a Morty baby!Hey!  Did you end up getting a new job?Yeah, I did. Assassinating you!I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm...  Ohh...No thank you, and bad math.What is the place?"The Creepy Morty". What is it your kind's always saying? "Don't think about it." Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet.They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore.Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Mortytown.  Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll.Morty...M-m-my partner. Morty, you're right. Mortytown is bad, but that doesn't mean that we have to be.Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works.Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Morty? You're fucking things up for both of us here!Big Morty, you're under arrest.S-smartest man in the universe.Not so big now, are ya?That's enough!If we don't kill him, he'll talk!If you do, I'll talk.You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing.Oh, Grandpa Rick! I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore! I want to be a regular kid! I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate!Same old story. Ricks killing Mortys.A bad place, but you're going to a better one soon.A portal to the Blender Dimension?! That's the oldest trick in the book! I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you!!Then come and get me, motherfuckers!!Rick. And I'm--Fifteen years.Where are we going?There's a Rick who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies.He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom.We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick.After you.I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace.I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine.None of those things are gonna happen, y'know. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel.Then why did you bring us here?Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.Well, I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there.Me, too. But I doubt it.NOOOOOOOO!!!!SLI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ICK!!!!Maybe... Maybe he went somewhere nice.He gotta be stopped...  He-he cou-couldn't be allowed to win.He's alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me!  I-I worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Morty is not what he seems.He... won?Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing.To what?I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired.  Good luck, turds.Holy crap... Slick's wish came true.Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!That was amazing!Got some of that mermaid puss!I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!So, Jessica, I heard you broke up with Brad.Who are you gonna date; now that you can date anyone?I don’t know. I mean, obviously if someone special comes along. B-But I mean really special, like, nothing I’ve even remotely considered in the past. Holyshitholyshitholyshit.I want that kind of love like that docking kind of love.Oh, yeah.Like, penis in the foreskin kind of love Mm-hmm just, like, warm, just like...Hey...  ah...Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure.You said I could go to school today.That was before I needed something, Morty. There’s a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, I’ll be awesome.We’ve been going non-stop, Rick. It’s not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessica’s single.Oh, that’s Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead.  Let’s go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure.They’re on our tail!Steady, Morty. Five cetons.Wha!Fire!Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up! Fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!I can’t fucking do this anymore!That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.So you agree?Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all. Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit.Why do you... Keep doing this to us?!I don’t know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I don’t I don’t know!We need a vacation.Isn’t that something?You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy.It's not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up.My whole body’s like a baby’s ass.Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins,  purifies your system.Oof, this guy on commission or something?I don’t think. Are you on commission?We’re not on  commission. We get  paid by the hour. There’s no incentive really- Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-We’ll try the machine, but but I’d like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that’s dangling around in the back of your throat.  It’s disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! That’s what you do.: Okay, Rick, come on. Enough.Wow, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill.Maybe you should go through twice.All right, mister comedy man, you don’t have to bust my balls. You’re not helping things.Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no- Morty!  R-Rick.Morty! Ugh! What Happened?We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine. It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, motherfucker!But this might do it. Run, Morty!E-Everything hurts!That’s because you’re worthless!  Jesus, how big was this explosion? I’m a genius. I don’t have time for this shit. W-W-We’re in Hell, aren’t we, Rick? You’re so stupid, Morty. You’re an  idiot. There’s no such thing as Hell.I believe you, but I just want to die.You can die when I say so. I control you. I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove. I’m surrounded by inferior pieces of shit and –Toxins. We’re not in Hell, Morty.  We’re in the detoxifier. The machine didn’t blow up. It worked normally.  It removed our toxins.  We’re the toxins. Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?!  We're what got removed!I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?  It’s all good.It’s nice of you to let me off the hook. It’s still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.Believe me, man, I’ve been working here a long time. I get it.Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music?Not at all.Grab my terrifolds...What is that?I just hit shuffle.Are you kidding?Haha.This universe.  Oh, excuse me.We should listen to one random song a day, you know? We’d end up hearing more songs we didn’t like, but we’d discover a lot more that we did.That is an interesting concept. You know, it makes me wonder if there’s an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio. Pfft! Listen to me, trying to calculate happiness over here.Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.Hey, here’s something no science could measure. I’m real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.Thanks, Rick. I love you.Yeah, motherfucker! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your fucking bitch ass, you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists, it’s fucking me!Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty. What do you think about that?Uh I th-I think my voice is annoying.It is, and it’s your best quality. So true.Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You don’t know or y’all just bored?Hey, listen, you know, wh-If we’re all bored over here, wouldn’t the common denominator be you?Damn, Morty. That’s hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character. Class dismissed!Awesome, Morty!You done good, Morty. Oh yeah!Thanks for the advice, Morty.You got it.I did it, Morty!I knew you could.Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldn’t play the trombone? Well, check this out!  Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time.Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself. There you are.You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know you’re still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade. I know that because I’m doing the same thing, brother. I’m not alone anymore!Hey, Morty. Word around school is you’ve become super healthy.I don’t know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven’t taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha!: Hey, kids. Uh, hope I’m not interrupting. Morty, a moment of your time?Happy to help, Rick.I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen.It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if something’s worth saying, I-it’s worth eye contact.Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen.Hey, asshole!Oh, man!Remember us?Oh, I don’t like confrontation!You fucked us, you pieces of garbage! That’s right, you’re fucking garbage, not us. I’m a fucking genius and a god. You really think this thing can hold me? I’m gonna rip your throat...Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live?W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us?Sounds like he’s in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldn’t have to deal with that, man. You know, l-let’s work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It’s amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen-I don’t think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn’t have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now I’m detoxed and I’m accountable to my toxins, right? I-It’s a dilemma.I think I know what to do. Morty!Rick! Haha.  You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldn’t be healthy.Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. World’s Greatest Grandpa, for reals.  It’s not just a coffee cup for you, bud. You’re legit. I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I’ll have a water.Uh How is the "cru-dite?"CruditÃ©. It’s a cup of carrot sticks.Ha! It’s okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. We’re having a conversation.God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long I’ve been waiting for this? It’s like, whew! I-I-I wish you’d shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, you’re so quiet. What’s wrong? W-Why don’t you tell me about yourself? What’s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where’s the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me.Well I... like this restaurant.Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! I’m an idiot. I can’t believe I haven’t thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. It’s an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right? Cooooool.  Oh, my God! I can’t believe this.Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to- I totally forgot my I have a thing, and...Things are good.You know what? Why am I doing that? That’s more rude than the truth. Look, I’m sorry, Morty. I just don’t think...Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. It’s all good.I think you’d get bored with me. E-Exactly. Look, the sparks aren’t flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. We’re gonna ride it all night lonnngg!Gonna eat some "crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm.  All right. You know, the evening continues.  Okay, here we go.Ma’am, I’m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your money’s no good here. Haha!  I’ll I’ll get the next round, sir.Aren’t you a child?Only in the ways that matter. Morty. Stacy.I’ve been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling you’ve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. That’s the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident I’m on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want.  What do you think about that? Okay. Fuck it.Tink. Mm! Let’s ask my grandpa. He’s a scientist.Hey, Rick, are you familiar with "Ben Wa" technology? Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier.Why? Because we’re coming home, bitch!What is this?This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real. Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too! I don’t want to be on camera. I’m ugly and gross, please.Should I go?You’re your own person, Stacy.Then I’d like to stay.Rick, please tell me you’re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us.Morty, I’m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can. Motherfucker!See? They’re living in pain.That’s what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They they’re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isn’t all some sort of crazy trick?Oh, so now because I’m made entirely of toxins I’m also a liar? Fuck you, you little sociopath.  You hear this, Morty?Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell. Y-You all hate me. All right, shut up, Morty. Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth. Don’t negotiate with that little turd, dummy. You’re the Rick. You need to show dominance. Morty, booth, now. Booth! Come on, Morty.Don’t touch me!Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself. Nooooo!Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot?Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door!I need to hear our safe word, Morty.Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!What are you doing?I’ll do anything for you, Morty.No!It worked! Haha! Yes! That idiot believed every word. Now let’s see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.He’s right behind me, isn’t he? He’s in front of you.Oh.  My eyes are still adjusting. Uh, is this like a sex dungeon? I guess I should’ve been paying attention.After 70 years of being bottled up inside a  sentimental jackass, I finally get to live my own life.You said we were merging.I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you?So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan?Not was, motherfucker, still is. Kill him, Rick! I don’t like this! This is scary! All right, you asked for it.Did I ask for this?  Did I ask for this?  Huh? Did I?Assessing threat to groin.Groin System 6000. Kill him! That... is my groin’s user.Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did.You know what? Not my table. You do know me.What the hell, Grandpa Rick?Fuck you, Summer!Sorry, Summer!Okay, okay, take it easy. Don’t do it.I love you. Good boy. Daddy’s little boy.Summer, get out of here! Go!Oh, who’s that? Who’s that over there? Oh, no.You see the bad man in front of you? You’re a good little boy, you’re gonna get him. You’re gonna get him.Ahh! Son of a...  Nice try, asshole.We can resolve  our issues. We don’t need to resort to over-the-top- Aah!I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank! I-I’m a piece of shit, but I got the tank!You’re going in that tank, motherfucker. You’re gonna  live in that toxic shit wasteland like I had to do!Ahh! Ow!  That’s right, motherfucker! You’re going in that fucki- Dads?Okay, just Just leave her out of it.What’s going on?All right, fuck this. Time for plan B If I can’t trap you in a toxic world, Ahh!I’ll just make the whole world toxic. It’s okay, girls. I-I’m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If you’d like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic?Believe me, sweetie, that man’s motivations are a mystery.Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. What’s the last thing you’d think about doing with that tank thing? Morty, I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but it’s not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd.Wait. That’s it.  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can’t. It must be by the individual’s own definition of toxicity. That means...Dad!What the What the hell, Rick? I’ll explain on the way.This "Moon Tower," Morty,  is the perfect height and metallic composition for the  amplification and beaming of toxic energies. What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty?Oh, man. I’m just freaked out. I-It’s too high up here.Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby. As we praise our loving Father- God is a lie! We made him up for money! Santa Claus isn’t real.  You were all mistakes!Hahahahahaha! We fucking did it, Morty. Put your fucking hands in the air.  Yeah, you little piece of shit.Remember me?Didn’t you learn last time that you can’t beat me?Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.  This.Ahh!!That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.You think I give a shit?I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I don’t. Here’s another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.  You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and you’ll know how to save him.Pfft. Come on, man. I’ve been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I’ve ever-Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!He’s cutting your time in half. 10 minutes.Ohh! It hurts!What is your problem?Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments.They must be somewhere. They ain’t over here, bro.I’m not going back in there!Honestly, I don’t care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say "honestly" you can believe it, because we both know I’m too healthy to lie. Watch.All right! Knock it off! You’re not impressing anyone.  Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay?Jesus Christ, it hurts.Relax, quit your bitching. Y-You’re gonna be fine. Grandpa’s here.Hahahahahaha.You think that’s funny?Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you can’t. You’re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess it’s just funny because you’ve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we’d be dead in five minutes.Ah, Rick?You poor, dumb, sick animal.Augh... Rick?Ahh!  Just do it! Just do it, you piece of-Aaahhh! I’m back, baby!  Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out!  Excuse me.  Now we’ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when I’m angry.God is not a lie.Mommy! Mommy! Ha! All right, Morty, now it’s time we re-merge your little ass.You’re a better man than me, Rick. I’m healthy enough to admit that!That kid is a real piece of shit. Y-Y-You’re gonna save me, right? Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to.  I’m telling you, these shares are hot.Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. It’s definitely a good idea. Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you?  That’s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down.  So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what’ll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You’re the boss.  Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three.  Heh.You little fucking monster.Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm!  Go for Morty.Hi, Morty. It’s Jessica. Look, can we just talk for a minute?Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location?Come back, Morty. I miss you.You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love ‘em back.How do you know I don’t want to love you?Because I’m not sick.  Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous? There’s nothing to be jealous of. I just realized that I’m scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel.We’ll be together. That’s a date.You are the perfect man.  Oh, sweetie,  I think you hit the wrong button. You didn’t hang up.Huh. How ‘bout that?Sorry, tiny American Psycho,  time to take the opposite of your medicine.Do what you got to do.Oh! Ow! Ahh! So, how do you feel, Morty?Ah, geez. I’m miserable.Am I good or what?I guess it’s worth it, though, to know how much you care.Care? Me? Morty, I’m fine with you. I only did this for him. You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. "Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?"Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.I wasn’t crying!Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn’t who I said I was.You weren’t a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn’t I?You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate.Well No-Not anymore. I’ll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones.She can’t keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They’re awesome.You can’t keep the drones.So, how was your date with Brad?It wasn’t a date. We were just having lunch.You guys are getting back together, aren’t you? Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, "need" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too.Okay.Morty.Good to have you back.Have you ever been peed on before? Oh, my God. Yum.Hey, did you ever want to hold a terrifold? I got one right here Grab my terri-flap Squeeze it Grab it, squeeze it Tug on my terri-flap Hey, I want to take you to The terrifold dance Wanna come with me? You can grab my holdie-folds Squeeze ‘em tight You son of a bitch. Suck my holdie-flappy folds Lick my flappy foldie-holes My terri-flaps in your mouth Suck my flaps, you piece of shit. Whoo!Although only a handful of moon towers remain today, they were popular in the late 19th century. An entire town could be illuminated by...  What the hell is this? Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!!Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?It's called "carpe diem", Morty. Look it up.You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.I'm ready when you a--Bitch, I was ready yest--Bye, sweetie.Well, I-I better--Sure. Sounds important.If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--Okay. Loser...What? Hello?Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!They all have mohawks!High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!Ah!Light them up.Ahh!Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!Give me your flask!Holy shit, Summer for the win!I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!Here we go.Isotope 322.Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!Summer!Hold on. I want to try something.Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!Your blood will be my lotion.Whoa. That was cool.Kill me, please.Okay, but not because you told me to.Summer!Okay, getting darker.Jesus Christ. Summer!Aw, come on.Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.What is your deal lately?All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there?That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods.Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers! Okay.What?!Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going.Sounds good. Stay hydrated.Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.Bicep or quadricep?Uh...  bicep. Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?No. Okay, I'll level with you.You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.Isotope 322.Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name, and the rest of their name was "Stalkers"!Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the "F" out of "H"!No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp."Distract"? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be...Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White. Ooh, burn!The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here.Ugh! Hey!I-I didn't do that!Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.Ooh! Help! Help!Oh, sweet, man!And so it begins, my pretties!Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?After the "boom-boom", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards.Jesus Christ, did the "boomy-booms" blow up all your "wordy-word books"?You mean dictionaries?I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.Want to piss on it?Get out of my head.Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!Okay, no more!And he wants more!No, I don't!Someone, make this stop!Morty. Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything! Hemorrhage: This family does.All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?Leave?I'm not leaving.There is no "leave". We are united, or we are enemies.Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.Hey, the Green Rock is gone! Oh, no!Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?When did I lose control here?Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?All right, you know what? Fuck it!My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!Nope, regular blood.Dad?Hi, sweetie.Where are the kids?Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.Not panicked. At all.Not a mistake, no!Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?What? Wait a minute.What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Ha!It can't be. It can't be!I was just following orders --Whoa, whoa!-- I was just following orders!Ahh!I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle!This isn't over, is it?That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?Ugh!Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.What about the weird guys on leashes, then?They're more like interns.Cool, cool.Sorry.It's okay.Can I see?No one has seen my true face and lived.Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like.Hmm?I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache.You hate it.No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of "mustache," in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"?I can shave it.No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you.Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, "Well, why not get rid of this?" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here  wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because --Hey, I'm doing a coffee run -- Never mind.I am Summer.Summer, state your deal.My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.Morty?Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.All right.It's dinnertime.Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.No problem.Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment.Uh, okay, weirdo. Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?How's school, Morty?I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- "staying together for the kids." End quote mode."Quote mode". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?All I know is, totally, you look great.Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It's crazy.So happy.So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag.Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --I don't know why I'm crying. It's not --Well, try crying 15% less?Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.I have to call Jerry.You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.Your feelings are coming from a --Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti --Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer --Ahh! Oh, gee!Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing.L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here!Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir.I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room.You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.Aw, fuck!Rick?Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.Yeah, well, too late.I want you and your sister to come home.Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here.The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.Wait. Can you stay to show us more?You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.Ugh. Goddamn it.Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day.Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.Oh, congratulations, guys.Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --I got it.She's a piece of work.They both are, right?I'm home.Hey, babe.Ah, Summer's home.Hey, there she is!You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.Blood Dome playoffs.So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success.Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!I still don't!Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that!Ohh! Ding, ding, ding!Uh, we should go to the garage.Oh, my God.Uh-huh.La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?!I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home.Coolsies. Noooooooooo!Downbeat!I enjoy this game.Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.We will return, possibly in different clothing.Why do we have to go into the garage?You know  it is  required.I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.What the fuck?Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello.Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.What the hell just happened?Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, "Downbeat"? No, thank you.Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?Sure.Thanks.Morty, are you okay?You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.Summer.This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.Thanks.I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right?Cool.So lots of hookers outside, huh?Is that what they are?Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check? ...loser...
