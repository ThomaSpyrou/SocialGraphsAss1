It’s the crowmad!Give it a second. Maybe he’s taking it out to surrender.He’s anti-heroic, run!I don’t understand.He’s only one man!With the power of a thousand crows!Good luck.Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care? What’s the point?Here’s two.Haha, yeah, cool.Morty?H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still.Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty. Morty, two crows. It’s good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up.Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like—It’s just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.Crow-horse. Crow-horse. Crow-horse.Caw, caw, caw.Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing.Take care, Morty.You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him—Ahem. I’m lookin’ for Crowscare. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.Rick!Morty?Wood?!Gahhh!Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick.Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.Do you have a rum and coke?What are you, twenty?Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.Time be going by, don’t she?That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?I feel okay.Well-well, what about me?Woah. Excuse us boys, you don’t wanna be here for this.Caw.I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase.Here’s your drink, poser.Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.Morty, what we had wasn’t healthy.And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!I hope that’s not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!Caw, caw, caw.Don’t defend him to me, I don’t even get what you see in him.Caw, caw.You’re right, we should be enjoying the time we have together.Crow Rick!Caw.Oh, I know what this must look like but—Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.Caw, caw, caw.What do you mean, ‘using me as a rebound’?Caw.You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could’ve been worse. At least ‘adventuring’ was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it’s not a real breakup.Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other’s bodies.What?! Eugh, no!Sounds like the man’s asking for proof! Let’s show him, fellas!Caw, caw, caw.Ah, aah.I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!I’m giving you free will. Yah!Submit to Crow-horse!Whoops.R-rick?Wubba lubba dub dub! I’m back, pal!Morty, who’s at the door?Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell’s going on here?See, um th-the thing is, uh—Can you please make Morty fourteen again, dad? This is ridiculous.Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I’m done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I’m ready to make this work.Let’s just hit the reset button.Well no, honey, not a reset, okay? Tell your grandpa that you’re worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on.I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together.Just like his old man.Don’t worry honey, that’s just Morty’s middle age talking. He’ll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.Uh, I’d like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I’d rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel.Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.Hi! I’m the Citadel’s new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn’t be home without Ricks aaand-ey Mortys!Dumb.Oof, what happened to this place?There’s a Morty president now.Ah, that’s cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.They made it Glendale.Goddamn you are cantankerous.Even pooping hurts now.Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.Okay, so… we’ve got a standard Morty that’s been aged to forty.Can you reverse it?Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle and graft its ends back together.Th-th-that sounds really violent.It’s not a literal bone, Morty.Oh, Okay.Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body.Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!I like crayons.Girls are gross.I-I-I think I feel like myself again.Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin’s all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed.Wait, what? I ain’t payin’ to store twenty-six years.Well, then you’re taking it with you.I’m almost ready to sell out.Alright, what’s disposal cost?S-something unfair’s happening!There’s no escape! No escape!Let me help you, this is not a good look!Oh boy.Hey, they shot me!You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience!Listen to me!Drop the gun!Death is coming for us all, and the Citadel is a weapon of mass destruc—Woof. You’re about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let’s get out of here before this gets political.U-uh. Was I influential?Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs.Tight. Uh.Ugh. Too late.C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.Woah! S-seriously?You know I destroyed this place?You’ve been pardoned for that, sir.Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president.Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he’s evil, we’re gone.I don’t know. Tastes pretty good.Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.Sorry I’m late. Never really ends around here.Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.And I hate ‘em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that’s a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.Geez, wouldn’t dream of it. But it’s amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.There’s the reveal. Let’s dance.Ha, geez.Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice.All politicians are nice.He’s a hot bag of peanuts, isn’t he?We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like—Serialized drama.Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.Wait, what?And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That’s why you got deformed Mortys comin’ up through the sewer lines talking about ‘hope’ and ‘change’.Fair enough.Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P?I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.Alright, time to go Morty.I wanna know what he’s talking about.Yeah, you’ve come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?Literally ten? Because now it would be six.Oh, I’m fine with that. Make it two… one. Like I said, would’ve been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure…You can’t scan an entire brain over appetizers.Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.You probably don’t remember.Check out season one, episode nine, Rickheads. Excel-uurp-cior!Evil Rick.We kicked his ass.Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.Looks complete. I was afraid I’d have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick.That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I’d hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can’t help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I’m sure you don’t know how far they’ve gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He’s an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he’s attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we’re with him. This is why we’re alive.What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true!It isn’t the whole truth.Liar!Liar.It’s complicated!I’m not busy!Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I’m basically Inspector Gadget.Uh oh.It’s okay, he’s free to go. He’s the Rickest Rick. We’ll never see him again.Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?Yeah.Holy shit!I only know one man that ever hacked my Portal Gun, and it turned out it was evil you.Yay. He’s all caught up.Wait! Hold it, hold it!Wh-who’s that?Time for Big Boy. Duck!Does he like it?He’s a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?Yoink!You can’t outrun your past, Rick.Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay.In uncertain times like these, I think it’s important for me to say: Eat shit, fuck you! The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don’t care— oh god oh fuck no, oh—And I’d just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.What’s happening, Rick?He hacked the entire city’s portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.What do you think he needed from your brain?I assume schematics for the Citadel’s Dimensional Drive. If he’s gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.What is the Central Finite Curve?Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.Or not.Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?Can’t you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We’re back to simple adventures.It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything.Morty, we really don’t have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you.Woah. Dead wife?Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.Of course that’s the case. In their minds, they’re the underdog.And that’s how they justify this.Morty, I’m not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it’s part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves. ‘Oh, it’s so hard to be a genius. Couldn’t you just die?’Well what are you doin’ about it?Jack shit. I’m leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he’s the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.And I’m leaving it. That’s what makes me ‘evil’, being sick of him. If you’ve ever been sick of him, you’ve been evil too.Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?There you go, kid. Now you’re Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.Don’t worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix.Doesn’t that still mean, like, death?Sure, but the joke’s on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.Oh my fucking god!Come on Morty, we gotta go!Woah!You can come if you want.Don’t blame me if you don’t.Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that’s the best deal on the table. I-I don’t have a real plan.Thanks, pal. I-I’m glad you ignored my advice.It’s just as well. I lied. That second seat’s a toilet.Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let’s go.Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.Woo-wee. Evil Morty. That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there’s an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need ‘im. Cuz, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo eee.I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there.Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.But then I guess I stopped.Cuz I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming.Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day , ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us.Wish I didn’t do that.Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don’t know, maybe you should try it.We don’t have as much time as we think. Ooo eee. You two are hungry.Big day.We're gonna kill God.Come again?Christian God is real, he's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill him.Mob style.Whack his ass.Can I kill God? Fuck off, Summer. Pfft, as if!Beth, do you hear this?Sweetie, don't get all worked up before your job interview.Job interview?Yes, is that so hard to believe?Actually, yeah. Something's off.No!Shit!Hunt me, hunt me, somebody hunt me!Don't hunt him to completion!Hunt me! Oh. Shit. Everyone start packing, no time to explain.Rick?Dad? What's wrong?Someone just killed a decoy family.I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?You made clones of us?Decoys, Morty. Very different.  Very different, sweetie.Different h-ow! Yeah, dad. Different h-ow?Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect–But why does he always want to be hunted?Jerry–It's not important right now, dad!Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit.So thankful this is my Saturday.Why was he in that cryopod?The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?Well, I don't see any stakes at all.Ah, shit!Guess we'll just be saying "ciao bella" to our deposit, then!Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family.Decoy family?Is this why you wanted to get out of town?You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you.  Well, that's a lie. Huh.So someone out there is trying to kill us?Someone's always trying to kill us. That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and– take bullets meant for us. Shit.Ahhh! No!Ah, shit. Decoy family.I think dad was still outside. What's a decoy family?Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!Oh, cool!We now return to When Wolf.Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in.Yeah, I never thought of the "were" in "werewolf" like "who, what, when and where!" Clever wordplay!When Wolf!Dracula! You know why I'm here.I'm safe here, Ian! Christianity hasn't been invented yet, crosses are just baby t's to me now! I got out. Please, don't invite me back in.Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff.You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20's and invest in the stock market, but then eat people.Yeah.Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it– whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.Decoy family? You made more clones?Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown.Do you just get hard creating sentient life?Actually, I get hard protecting my family!Ew.Ugh, gross!Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelgängers. Cool deal.The decoys are harmless, Beth.Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum.So they think they're us?That's the deal.How do you know we're not decoys?  Oh my god, we're decoys.Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!What do I do?My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I'm real, you have to help me, I'd never joke about this.  There's a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek.What?Morty, please, I'm begging you!I'm not looking at your ass!Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it!  Just tell me if I'm real!Morty, do it!Gross!Dad!Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys.Why did I get punished?A, decoys don't build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom.Fuck off.Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!Think you got the wrong house, bro.Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5.Kind of expected a funnier password.I didn't plan on showing them off. Damn, like Westworld!Yes, Morty, like Westworld. But don't fuck them.  Summer!Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room.Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an exact replica?I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty.Shit.You know you can use tissues, right?I can't finish without it.So you do know what a happy family looks like.I know what a fake one looks like.Uh, Rick? What?Did you use this house to make decoys, too? What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to–  okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids.  Isolate head at normal processing.  What the fuck do you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?Wait, how do you—oh god, Summer was right.Everyone in the car.You said decoys didn't make decoys.And usually, they don't, but again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless.  Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program.Terminate? They're alive, dad!And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab.Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than Blade Runner.I still think we're decoys.You just want an excuse to stop trying.Yeah, and? Oooh, there's a handsome fellow!Uh-oh.I thought you made them harmless.I don't remember making this one. Oh, hi, Rick! Family...me...? Hey, when did you all leave?Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5.Hmm?Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it's making you loopy! Happy analysis mode! Happy analysis mode to you, too!Think you got the wrong house, bro.Analysis mode, password 8-0-0–Shit, you think I'm a decoy?How do you know about the decoys?They were my idea! Well, now I know you're pranking me.Analysis mode, password 8 equals sign equals sign capital "d".Hide.What?Hide!Wow, like Ex Machina!Yes, Morty, like Ex Machina. But don't fuck them. Summer!Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room.So you do know what a loving family looks like.A simulated one, yes.Why are we hiding?He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys.But we're not decoys!Sure, tell him that.Rick, did you make decoys here, too?Morty, for what reason could I have for...what the– isolate head at normal processing!  You dumb asshole, you made decoys?Again, they were my idea. Wait, what happened to the other guy?Other guy?Wait, that means I'm a decoy. Fucking Summer.Check the closets.They've gone rogue!Killer decoys!Take out the decoys!Shit! Someone put a gun in my teeth!Stop shooting, dad! They're us, we don't have to fight them!Classic prisoner's dilemma, Beth. I'm a cool guy, I, you know, I can talk it out. But that asshole–Me? You decoy piece of shit. You're the one that shot first!We can work this out, just stop trying to kill each other!Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way, with one of us accepting we're a decoy.And once he knows he's a decoy, he know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he's him.Pretty perceptive, for a decoy.This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.Do we have to do this?Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?Oof.I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ.We rush them on three. Ready?I don't want to kill us, Rick!It's them or us, Morty. I don't trust me. Do you trust you?Yes?Freak.Before you say anything, they were already killing each other.Well, you could've done something.Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade.Sorry, what's happening?I need an explainer, too.Yeah, I'm pretty much behind on this one.Car, can I get a whiteboard?  When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys.Say decoy again.Fuck you.Well, how do we stop it?Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander rules now.  Really? 1986? "There can be only one?" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays "the spaniard" but does nothing about his accent.Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it?Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys.Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess, nobody else with our face and memories has to die.Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?You're helping us fix this. We're taking out the squids.I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us–Engage in B stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families.Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.This costume smells like ass!God, there's no pleasing you!It's really bad, Rick.Did you let a gym coach break it in?Why are we wearing these?Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to.Which we won't.Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people. Oh my god! You are, aren't you? You're worried you might be fake!Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else's squid costumes.There's one.  Hey, what're they mad at you for, anyway?Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick's too big, the list goes on and on.Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let's loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown.Huh.Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids...Well, I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me!Honestly, probably for the best. Man, I'm good.Dad!Oh, shit. One of mine.Where are we going?Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife.That licks.We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks.Oh, maybe now you'll empathize with the decoys you're killing!Wait, shhh. It's too quiet.You skipped quiet.I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.Yeah, but you're supposed to say–You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough!Where are we? Where's Rick?He's right here, Morty!  Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look...different? Oh, god! Ugh, it stinks!Yes, recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them.You see, Ricks, they get lazy. There's always a shitty decoy towards the end. But those decoys made decoys too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line...there be monsters.Ugh, we get it, you're ugly and mad about it. Rick! Grandpa!Kill me... if I ever get this arch.Hush, little decoy. Can't kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh.You know what? You're a monster.I'm your father! At least, I can look more like him once I harvest all this yummy skin.This guy's really into skin.It's not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.Will I beautiful again, daddy?Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon.What the–Help the others!Why are you helping us?Because we're all in this together. Come on! There's a place we can go!Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river!Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle!Also, y'know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface.Excuse me for wanting to live.Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To our cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers.Whatever.Asshole!We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god, and drive to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!I don't know if that's accurate.Sounds extreme.But that violence ends today!What about the squids? The squids are decoys! There were no squids!The squids are decoys who realized they're decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.Yeah, it is a lot.We cannot let confusion divide us!Squids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys!Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!I'm sorry, I didn't ask for this! I just wanna live! But there's only so much varnish! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!How long before the other decoys find us?Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.I'm just glad we're living to the fullest with the time we have left. Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next?Jerry? Bucket list?I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.Nope! Morty?I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming.They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit!You're so mean today! I'm your dad, you like having me around!You keep putting us in danger!Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a Star Fox boss season four callback? Make it flashy?You got it, babe. Let's go, you little bitch.  It's showtime.  Get centered.What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter!  I know what you're thinking: "Fuck, a beacon! That's a great idea! He's got home turf,  a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!"  And now you're thinking "shit, that's totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake!  I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass."  Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I'm gonna loop it. Why is it–Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the American Southwest.Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral collage is–To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve. I have the internet too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette and bring me a Diet Coke.Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool.We might be decoys, huh.One way to find out.Looks like it's calming down. You wanna get in one more "I told you so" about synthetic life or whatever this week's theme is?Oh, fuck you. Whoa.No, you don't get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you're terrified of losing either!Shit.Yeah.Look, Beth, I might not be the real Rick. But even if I'm not, he made me, or the me that made me. Which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that. A version of Rick who's sorry. I'm sorry about the clone thing, too. I love you.Thanks, dad.I love you, too. You really think we're decoys?Eh. Who cares? We'll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon, this was gonna take weeks.  Alright, let's mop up.Finally.Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I'm not sure it helped, but I'm glad we tried it.We're losing the costumes?Thank god, this decoy outfit smells like ass.Fuck you, Summer.Shit, that guy's awesome. Okay, listen, he might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens–Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise.Wait, I don't know who to shoot.Summer!I can't deal with this. I had to kill myself. You have too, to.Summer!Fuck you, I'm real! I'm the smartest man in the universe!Probably not even wrong. But that's just it. I'm not a man. I'm God!You're just made in my image.Fuck you.You the, uh, Summer I came with?Probably.Good enough. Morty?Yeah.I'm here, too.Holy shit, that was insane! I love you guys, I've totally changed!Oh, fuck.You shoulda hunted me.What? Who—were you significant? Like, did we tee you up? You want to be hunted? God, I have so many questions. Why? What happens if– Somebody hunt me!Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big, long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space Beth. Maybe that'll happen more often!Let's not overdo it.Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family. Decoy family? Decoy what now?Hello?Oh, oh my god! Oh my god!No! No, no no, no no no no no!Nooooo!Oh god. Yes, yes, sweet death.Why am I still alive? Oh, god. Is there anything left? Hello?What is it?A relic...from a kinder past.Wait, cowboys?Christianity again? After cowboys? You went all the way back around?!Oh god, why can't I die? This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone!
