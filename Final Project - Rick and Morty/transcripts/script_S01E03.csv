Jerry, Last King Christmas last arrived!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry," In the Christmas Christmas!  Mmm... Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Um, Merry Christmas?  Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,Alive? For your parents?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,Good one.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,Hey man!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty," You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Ohhhh...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,"Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick," Ho ho ho, everybody.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ruben,Pearl Harbor.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,I check in on him once a year and give him a little  medical  evaluation.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"Aw, Dad... That is so sweet.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry," Yeah, it is... I don't get it.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ruben,Korea.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry.  Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Huh. You think you know a guy.  Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday.  Hey hey!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard,"Merry Christmas, son.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Oh, hi. Can I help you?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Joyce,"Jerry, this is Jacob.  Didn't you get our text message?",1,3,Anatomy Park
"Beth, Summer, and Morty",No.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry, I wish... But thank you.  So... you're a...friend of the family...?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard," The way we see it, he's a part of the family.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,Wow!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Joyce,"After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard,Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,All three of us.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,...Cool... Eggnog?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Now we are talkin’! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Hi Joyce, Leonard.  Hello there.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Merry Christmas, man.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Morty! A moment of your time?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"He's in bad shape, Morty.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin’ here trying to save the guy's life!  I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin’ on.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,In Ruben. ,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Ruben... Minnesota?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Ruben on the table, Morty!  Look, I-I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything.  Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,W-What proc—,1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"Hey Dad, where's Morty?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,He's busy.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Morty, can you hear me? Head North!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Rick... Where am I?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick," Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,The entrance to what?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Welcome, Morty.  Welcome...  ...to Anatomy Park!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"It's a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom.  An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"You got a problem with that last one, Morty?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Proceed to the liver.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Automated voice,Arriving at ‘Liver’.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Ow!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Automated voice,Mind the gap.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"It's really scary in here, Rick.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco—  —holism.  That is an animatronic werewolf.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Poncho! That's quite enough.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Morty, that's Poncho.  This is Roger and Annie.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Oh...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin’ on here?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Exhibits?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Watch it.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Diseases?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,"Hey Doc, I have news for ya.  Your living museum is officially a wild safari!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,Hepatitis A! Run!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Oh...  The food goes in your mouth, girl!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Joyce,"We can go into detail later, son.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard,"Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.  And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Dad, please, what are you saying?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard.  And we support you.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard,"No no no no.  Jacob is your mother's lover.  I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,Oh... ,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer," Happy human holiday, Dad.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,AHHHHHH!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,That's strange...  Air flow is down twenty percent.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"W-Well, I guess we better check it out.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Alexander,"Hey, wait for me! ",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom, Put that back on!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,"If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, I'll go.  Heheh...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,"Don't be a hero, kid.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,I'm not. I'm doin’ it because it's fun. ,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho, We shouldn't be here.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,Ah!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"It's alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue...  ...keeps them dormant.  Morty! Get down!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Whoa!  Whoa!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Oh! What are those things?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Tuberculosis, coming in fast!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho, Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom, No! Do you know what you've done?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Alexander,Waaaah! Don't let me die!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Just take a deep breath, Ruben.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,You're not gonna die! What's your name?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Alexander,My name is...  ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Oh, great work, Morty.  I'll just cure it, and then—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"—and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick," It's a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"—please, you gotta treat yourself.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Geez, what's that horrible smell?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"You mean the Panda Express?  Kidding, I-I'm kidding.  The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Everybody! Get to the colon!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Now I'm takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know...",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,What?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Not twelve.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,Okay.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Because he just said I was twelve.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,Oh. Good for you.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Nnn...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Animatronics," It's a road of laughter, a trail of food. It's a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It's a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It's a small, small intestine!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,It goes on like this for miles...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom, And then we get to the large intestine!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Shh.  I hear something.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom, Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,We’re sitting ducks!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Yes. Why?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Kid! You're a genius! ,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,Are you mad?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty, Everybody! In here!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer," Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Leonard,"Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,Christmas drums being played by a boy!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,Ugh... Summer!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer," Ethan, what are you doing here?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,Did you even consider how that might make me feel?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry," Summer, do you have a boyfriend?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,"Yeah, do you, Summer?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,"I don't know Ethan, do I?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob," Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,"I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,What the hell is that?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,"Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Poncho? What is this in your backpack?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Everybody get back!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho," That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you!  You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,AHHHHH!!!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Poncho,Ah! Eh! Get! Get off!  Ahhhh!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,You guys!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,"It's gonna burst!  Go! Go, go, go!  My foot is stuck!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,No!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Roger,"This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,No!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,From Summer being a total bitch!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,Where's the anger coming from?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,...My brother... took me fishing once...in the bushes...  I can't... I can't!  He made me feel like a girl!  I'm... m-made me a girl!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are.  She is who she is.  Now you go to her. Brand new.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,Come here right now!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan!  I love you!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,I love you so much.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,Um...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Joyce,"You did it again, cubby. Come here.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,No! Stop! I hate this!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Joyce,"Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Animatronic Ruben,"My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Animatronic Ruben,My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie, You can put your fingers wherever you want…,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? ",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,I’m trying to concentrate.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Ah, Rick?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick," Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry," I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you.  Right now, you’re my sanest relative.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite!  Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben's left nipple!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,We need to get to the left nipple!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"The body is decaying!  The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the Bone Train.  Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,If it'll get us out of here.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let's go.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"...Uh, well...",1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie, What the hell is that?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,E. coli outbreak. Hurry!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Dr. Bloom,"Oh wait, there is an autopilot.  WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,They're chewing through the doors!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Euuuugh!  We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"I'm almost there, Morty!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Reporter,Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Tom,"Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Reporter,"Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Eric,"We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Reporter,"Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Oh my god, the track!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,It's Hepatitis A!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,The nipple hole...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,It's beautiful...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,Aw no!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,I... think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Oh. Huh.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Where's Dr. Bloom?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,Sorry Rick... He's dead...,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,"I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,It's raining blood!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,"Oh, shit. find Jerry!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,Oh god.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Beth,Jerry!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry, It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Reporter,The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,"Dad, can I have my phone back?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Sure, sweetie.  Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Jacob,This is nice.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Jerry,"Yeah.  I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Summer,"No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Too bad about Dr. Bloom.  He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,"Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Booyah! Hold your breath!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,"Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.  Puffy vagina.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Morty,W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"C’mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.  Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,"Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Loud and clear, Annie.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,"Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Alejandro,Hey Rick.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,"Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,Hey everybody.,1,3,Anatomy Park
All,"Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin’. ",1,3,Anatomy Park
Annie,So. Pirates of the Pancreas.,1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Yeah, talk to me.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Alejandro,"Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?”  And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,"So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?",1,3,Anatomy Park
Rick,"Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.",1,3,Anatomy Park
Ethan,... Cool. And who pays me?,1,3,Anatomy Park
