Rick,T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Wh… convincing?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Uhhokay.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Beth,"*robotic* I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. ",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,What's with Mom?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is?  Morty?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Uh, me?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,What is 5 x 9?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jessica,"Whoo! Way to go, Morty!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,*spying from outside* Interesting…,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Student,"Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, that's a good question.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Concentrated huh?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Uhhh…,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jessica,"Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jessica,"I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Uh, y-you will?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"*kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Goldenfold,"Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,He doesn't care.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Take a shower with me, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,What?!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"I can’t let you do that, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Give it to me!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,No! You give it to me!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,G-g-give it!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Morty, come on! Morty!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"No, Rick!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 1,"Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 1,"I think we should make Kevin look, sir.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Kevin,What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Stu,"Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Stu,"Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder.  There's another real human in the simulator.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 2,"Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 3,Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Kevin,"Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Stu,"Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"*sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,*inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Radio,"This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Rick!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Okay, okay, you got me on that one.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? ",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Paramedic,"We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,National Apple Farmers of America…,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.  Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry.  With that, I give you your new slogan!  Well, say something! Do you like it?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,You do?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
All,Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,So I sold it? I sold the idea?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
All,Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Oh my god! Thank you!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
All,*shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You're welcome.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Hey! I just sold my first pitch!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Old man,Slow down!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Woman,Lookin' good.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mailman,My man!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Simulation Beth, *answers phone* Hello.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Guess who just sold the apples campaign.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Simulation Beth,Who just sold the apples campaign?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of ""got milk?"" after all. Guess someone was wrong.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Simulation Beth,Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Simulation Beth,Okay.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Wait, really?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Simulation Beth,Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Woman,Lookin' good.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Old man,Slow down!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mailman,My man! *glitches into a tree*,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"You got that right, Rick.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah!  All the ladies say, ""yeah!""  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! ",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"*kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Holy crap!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Come on, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,*jumps off edge*,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion,"Sir, they're over the edge.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Totes malotes, dawg.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Just kind of hard to believe, you know?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. ""Hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""Got milk?"" It's almost identical.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"*crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in ""Hungry for Apples"" that's shared by ""Got milk?"" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Yeah! Wait. Really?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Could we nominate me?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Holy crap!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.  Huh. I thought I entered the code right. ",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Cynthia,"Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,Uhh…,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,That is why you're never getting home. Get them!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,RUN MORTY!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Oh my god!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mailman,My man!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mailmen,My my my my man!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Aah! What the hell?!  No.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,Jerry?!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Dad!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,*sobbing* No!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Whoa! It's all here, Rick!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,*freezes up*,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Oh, no.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,What the…?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,No!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"*laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 1,Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Kevin,"You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Zigerion 1,I don't know. Can you?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you?  *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Cynthia,"Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"*loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,"You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Prince Nebulon,"All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient…",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,So… What do you think?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,You're fired.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Jerry,Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,"Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Mr. Marklevitz,"Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Hey, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,What?,1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Oh, boy.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Morty,"Have you been drinking, Rick?",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Rick,"I really appreciate you, Morty.",1,4,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
