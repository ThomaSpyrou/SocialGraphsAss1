Giant Lawyer,"Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
Rick,W-what the hell is he talking about?,1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
Giant Lawyer,"They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
Morty,"Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy

Morty,"All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy

Morty,"You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
Rick,"Uh, because it's lame?",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
Morty,"It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!",1,5,Meeseeks and Destroy
