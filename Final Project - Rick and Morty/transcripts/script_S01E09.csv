Morty,"Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Whatever.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Beth," Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty," Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Butter robot,What is my purpose?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Pass the butter.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Thank you.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Dad, I need a ride to work.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,I’m busy.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Doing what?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Uh, anything else?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Butter robot,What is my purpose?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,You pass butter.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Butter robot, Oh my god.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Since when did you have a job?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Please don’t.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,Oh… when did this stop being jamba juice?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"I’ve just recently opened for business, Mr, um, Goldenfold.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,You know my name? That’s disarming.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,I also know you long for female company.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,"You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can’t be filled with jamba juice.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge: one never pays here. Not with money.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,Nothing to read into there! Thanks!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick, Huh.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Tell me Rick, what do you desire?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,What? Sorry?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Grandpa Rick!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this.  This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Hahahahaha.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Grandpa, go home and drink!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Oh. Ok.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry," Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Morty, nobody changed the planets.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,You… disagree?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Um, ok, I just have to-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Oh.  Okay good. This is gonna be fun!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Um…,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Well that’s retarded.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,What are you guys talking about?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Apparently nothing.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,No!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,It’s not.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Shut up, Rick.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Whoa.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Stay scientific, Jerry.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price… for everything! Muahahahaha!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold, Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,This serum should counteract the negative effects.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold," Holy cats! Ladies, let’s get out of here.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Goldenfold,I haven’t learned a thing!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick, Here. You can have this back.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,You didn’t use it?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say,  a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Be quiet!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling  beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,I find this all quite preposterous!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo.  That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Do I need to call the police?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Hey! No! Ugh!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Think you’re so great?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Stop it!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Grandpa Rick, I like working here!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,You work for the devil!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,So what?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick and Needful,"""So what""?!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Whoops.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but…",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"It’s fine. Summer, you know your grandfather’s right. This store curses people. That’s my business.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Please, call me the devil.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"I’d rather not, actually.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Yes, perhaps not during business hours.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first!  I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Dad, what’s your endgame?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Ain’t no game, sucka.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry and Morty,"Whoa, whoa! Whoa!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,What the hell?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"I’m King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,I’d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Oh. I…,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he’s creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Pluto… is a planet.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Pluto’s a fucking planet, bitch!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty," Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"If it’s athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Vagina, I’ll take it!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,But I haven’t even-,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Vagina,"Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather’s outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I’ve had since Salem!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Is that the vegan place?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Yeah, I love their soup.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,I’m kind of souped out.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Tate,"Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s free, right?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money. ,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful, That was perfect.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Tate,"You pay with the curses, right?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Um, I… well-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Tate,"Well, I’m going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,What?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that gives you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, $8,000,000? See ya at the Olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Baby,Everything’s deductible.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Don’t pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We’re located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,First… and…,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Wubba… lubba… dub dub!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Wubba lubba dub dub!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"That’s right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Diabolical son of a mother-,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Hostess,"We’re back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Pluto is a planet.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Host, How about that?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Hostess,Wow. I love it!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,Morty Smith. I’m Scroopy Noopers. I’m a scientist. Can I show you something?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Uh… I’d better not.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers, Right now.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,"The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,"There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won’t wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof. ",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Um… A party?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,Is everyone in your family an idiot?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,For sure me and my dad are.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers," Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Ah! Oh my god!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Oh my god.  I wish this desk was lighter!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer, I wish this knot was looser!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing?  I wish I knew CPR!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"One, two, three! One, two, three!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful," Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"I’m the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,You haven’t failed.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I’m smart and funny.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name it.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,I wanna help you.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Clever twist.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"That was important to you, wasn’t it?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,He tried to kill himself.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,So?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,So… have fun not caring.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,I always do.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Good.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Yeah, it is good. It’s the best.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,I’m sure it is. Bye.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Later!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Customer,I’m here to pick up my undead cat and child.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Employee,These are the forms for the employee health plan.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,I just got bored. Everybody out.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,You told me science wasn’t easy!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Dad, their whole planet is dying!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"What’s up, Pluto?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Plutonian woman,"Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Plutonian man,My god! The man’s a genius!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Um, excuse me? ",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Morty, what?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Plutonians,,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Good one, dad.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick," Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh.  Hey Beth? Hello?  Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? ",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,"Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Butter robot,I am not programmed for friendship.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Suit yourself.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Hey!  Hey. What’s going on?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Rick,Whatever.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"I’m flattered, and humbled.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Policeman,Your highness! We’ve captured Scroopy Noopers!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,You animals! Animals!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Ooh, look whose little journey’s come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Scroopy Noopers,"You can’t kill the truth, father!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,What?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"I can see you’re confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,It’s a what?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Flippynips,"Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That’s what I meant. Knock ‘em dead out there, you. ",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Pluto is…,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes

Crowd,Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"Okay, that’s it! We just got bought by Google!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Crowd,Yeah!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,"Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,Haha. ‘We.’  This is my business! Security!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Summer,Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Needful,"I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg’s balls dropped. I’m the devil, beeyotch! What what!",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Hey!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,Hey Morty.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Oh! Hey dad!  Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that.",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,"Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A. ,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Butter robot,Butter.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,But-,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes

Jerry,Oh. I uh- I think I underst-,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes

Jerry,I get it! Say no more.,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Morty,"I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-",1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
Jerry,I got it! Noted! Goodnight!,1,9,Something Ricked This Way Comes
