Beth and Jerry in unison,That's right.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,Wait... What?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song ""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song?  From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?",1,11,Ricksy Business

Rick," Because  I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,What do you mean you're having a party?  Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"""Glip glop?"" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,Is that like their n-word?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --",1,11,Ricksy Business

Tour Guide,"After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.",1,11,Ricksy Business

Beth,"Do you mind if I skip the whole ""king of the world"" bit?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,"Well, it's not the ""king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio.  This is where rose says, ""I'm flying, Jack!"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth," Well, what about her?",1,11,Ricksy Business

Morty,"Hey, uh, what the hell?!",1,11,Ricksy Business

Rick,"Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?",1,11,Ricksy Business

Lucy," Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,It's so romantic.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,I can't wait to do that with Beth.,1,11,Ricksy Business

Captain #2,What do you mean there's not a problem?,1,11,Ricksy Business

Rick,"Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,I thought everyone was welcome.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler,"Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler, But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! ,1,11,Ricksy Business

Brad,What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jessica,"Leave him alone, Brad.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Brad,"Stay out of this, Jessica!",1,11,Ricksy Business

Jessica,It's beautiful.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jesica,"What's that, Morty?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,I think that you're the most --,1,11,Ricksy Business

Morty,"Oh, my God!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Squanchy,"Hey, I'm squanching in here!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,Huh. Big star in the sky.  Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters.  We'll be fine! Let's party!,1,11,Ricksy Business
Stereo,"♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,"I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick," Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax!  It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals.  Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Okay. Let's go, then.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,Yeah. Me too. I should stay.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler,You guys have any aspirin?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler,"Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Shut up, Lincoler.  It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer," Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Nancy,What? Why -- why me?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,"Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Captain #2,"Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry," Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth, I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. ,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,But -- but --,1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,"You see, Jerry?  May I show you something?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,"Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,"I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a ""Titanic"" failure.  Get it?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry, Ooh!,1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,"Draw me, Jerry.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry," Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,"Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy, You are gonna draw me.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,Aah! ,1,11,Ricksy Business
Lucy,Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there. ,1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler," It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty," Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Nancy, There they are!,1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler,Wait. Something's not right.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Abradolph Lincoler,Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! ,1,11,Ricksy Business

Rick,"All right! You did it, Morty. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.  He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.",1,11,Ricksy Business

Morty,What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!,1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty.  Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?",1,11,Ricksy Business

Lucy,No mess. No clean.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry, Beth!,1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth,Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth,I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Jerry,"What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth,What?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth,"Well, at least you got all this free stuff. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Beth,Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.,1,11,Ricksy Business

Summer,What?,1,11,Ricksy Business
Squanchy,Nancy told us what a bitch you are. ,1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,"Guys, seriously. Nancy?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Nancy,"Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Summer,"Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.  You're so wise.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Rick,"  Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... ",1,11,Ricksy Business

Morty,"Uh, sure, yeah.  Thanks. ",1,11,Ricksy Business
Birdperson,"Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means?",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Birdperson," It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me.""",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Birdperson,"No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.",1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Come on, um...",1,11,Ricksy Business
Birdperson,Birdperson.,1,11,Ricksy Business
Morty,"Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.",1,11,Ricksy Business
