Rick,"Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Cool.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on.  Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool.  Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,What are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s learning to drive.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"I guess I remember that.  Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Yep.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,This is where we’re going?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Nope.  This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter,Well look at this fella.  Aren’t you handsome?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Thank you! I’m Jerry. ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter," Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter,"Oh, they’ll be back soon.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,What?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Pajama Jerry,I don’t know how this works!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Underpants Jerry,Help me!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,What the hell?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Pajama Jerry,"I know, right?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Tuxedo Jerry," Oh, what the hell?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"I know, right?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Receptionist,Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Okay, wait here.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,I wanna come with.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s  business stuff.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Ah, crap.  Hey, what’s up?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Krombopulos Michael,"Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D’you have the weapon?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Krombopulos Michael,Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Ugh.  Here, now go away.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Krombopulos Michael," Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can’t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered,  please give me a call. I’m very discrete—",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Krombopulos Michael,"I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,…You sell weapons to killers for money?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Uh, what?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.  Here, check this out.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy,Ah!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy’s mother,"Roy, what’s wrong?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy,I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy’s mother,"It’s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don’t want you missing school on Monday. ",2,2,Mortynight Run
Teacher,I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.  Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Announcer,"Spiraling perfectly, it’s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20!  Now he’s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy’s wife,I just think it’s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Doctor,"Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy,I’m not…ready to die…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy’s wife, You’re not going to.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Customer,"Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Voice," Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Roy,Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, W… Where’s my wife?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. ",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. ",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Alien, Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid!  This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter,Well of course! Right through that tube. ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, Unbelievable. ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter,You’re doing great!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, I know how to crawl in a tube.  Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks…  Whoooooaaaa!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco?  Marco?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry,Come find me.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco? ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Pink-shirt Jerry,How so?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Daycare Beth,Jerry!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry,Beeeth.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Daycare Beth,"I love you, Jerry!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Aw… Beth…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Daycare Beth,Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerrys,Oh! Yes! Definitely!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Daycare Beth,First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high! ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry,Out of my way!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Another Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Krombopulos Michael,"Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Ship,You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty," All out of off-white Persians…  Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! ",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gromflomite, Drop the gun!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gromflomite,I guess that makes two of us. ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,You saved my life!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,What?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Morty, don’t do it.  Morty…  Morty, you idiot!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty," Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh…",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,Fart.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,More are coming.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Screw this. I’m out.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Oooh…! Come on, come on!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gromflomite,Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, Oh no no no!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gromflomite,Open fire!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker!  Move!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,More are coming.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Rick!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Yeah, yeah. ",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gearhead,Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gearhead,"Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire—",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," So I’ve heard. Just fix it.  I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile.  Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"You do understand I’m telepathic, right?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,I’m being polite.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call “get out of my head, Fart, I know you’re in here, la la la la—” No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick, Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,I could not agree more.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart," The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space  / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby—",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Random Jerry," Duck, duck, birdie?  Very funny!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Here comes another funny…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry,"Hahaha! Oh, this place is great.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry, You just might.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,W-What do you mean?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerry,These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back.  …They live here now.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Uuuum…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gear Anchor,No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives  reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Son of a…  Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.  That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us!  Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gearhead," I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gearhead,Friend? Do you even know my real name? It’s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ‘Gearhead’ is like calling a Chinese person ‘Asia-face.’,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gearhead,"No, not twigs!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Gear Policeman #1,Nobody move!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gear Policeman #2,Oh my god.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Gear Policeman #1,Are those…?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"I did the right thing, Rick!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,You did that!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, I can’t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Bearded Jerry,Ante up.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,You know what?  Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys.  I say we escape.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Bearded Jerry,"If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Tank-top Jerry,You think we’re kept here against our will? That would be illegal.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"But… If you can leave, then why are you still here?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Buzzcut Jerry,Same reason as you.  …We’re Jerrys.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,I’m leaving.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry-Sitter,"Okay then, that was always allowed.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Morty, take the wheel!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Whoa, whoa!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Whoa!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?!  Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"Um, Rick!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Shit. Well, I guess this is it.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Morty, crack the window.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Officer,"Well… He’d probably like to have me to himself, that’s how friends are.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,Or does he want her to himself?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Officer, My life is a fucking joke.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Goodbye, moonmen. / You say, goodbye, moonmen.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Goodbye, moonmen…  Alright, let’s proceed.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, Are you done?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done.  Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Garblovian,Ga-ga blahg blahg?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Um… Earth, please?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Um… Is this… Do I pay?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Garblovian,Agah blahg-blah! ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Sorry!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Hmm. Hmm…  Agh! ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Garblovian,Agah blahg blahg?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,I don’t…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Garblovian, Agah blahg!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,What do you want?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Garblovian, Agah blahg blah—,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Oh!  Ahahaaaahhhhh….,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, Uhhh… Huhhh….  Oooh! ,2,2,Mortynight Run
Tank-top Jerry,"Hey, are you the one that left?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,,2,2,Mortynight Run
Tank-top Jerry,I get it. It’s… uh… a hassle out there.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry, Right? Who needs that?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Jerrys, Right? Not me.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Paul,"Oh-ho, not us!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,Uh… Who are you?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Paul,"Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleishman.  Infinite timelines! In some of them Beth remarries.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,…Geez…,2,2,Mortynight Run
Paul,"Don’t worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there’s no replacing you. Hey, you wanna give us a hand with this?  We’re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. I-I-I don’t—It’s very difficult.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Tank-top Jerry,"I tried that, but there’s two different colors.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Various Jerrys,Uh… There’s two different colors.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,The wormhole is seventy of what you call ‘meters’ what you call ‘north’ of what you call ‘here.’,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"I’m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I’m really sorry your name became Fart.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"I will be back soon, Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, Really?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Um… Cleansing…?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice.  You haven’t changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty, Um… Before you go… Could you sing a… C-Could you sing for me again?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,"Yes, Morty.  Cosmos without hatred / Blinding stars of cosmic light / Quasars shine through endless night / And everything is one in the beauty / And now we say goodby—",2,2,Mortynight Run
Fart,Morty… Why… Why?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,Goodbye.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know?  You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty," What?! Rick! No, you can’t!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,"No, no, Rick! You don’t understand!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Hey.  Hey bro. How many people was your Morty responsible for killing today?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Rick,"None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain’t that right homie?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Morty,Darn right bro! Roy rules!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Rick,Haha!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick," Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,"Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?,2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerry,I’d like that.,2,2,Mortynight Run
Another Rick," Hey, wait, do you have 5126?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Other Rick,"Uh, that’s a Blips and Chitz ticket.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Morty,What?!,2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Jerrys,"Uh… W-wait, what?",2,2,Mortynight Run
Ricks,"Alright, come on, Jerry.",2,2,Mortynight Run
Announcer,"Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz!  We got, uh… one game! We got a whole bunch of games here! Uh, we got chabos and flobos and you can shoot things! Get on over here and play the games! Use your Flurbos to get tickets! Roy 2 just got here! G-Get over here at Ch… Chips and Chitz!",2,2,Mortynight Run
Rick,"It’s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!",2,2,Mortynight Run
