All," Come together. With love. connection, experience! ",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,It's my favourite song,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Hahahahaha, yeah",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,You're excited about that?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty and Summer,Whoa!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Seems like something terrible happened here.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Uh, what's that?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,That's horrible!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"I hear you man, cops are racist.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Female alien,Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of  entity! It absorbed the minds of our people!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Male alien 1,"We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Male alien with glasses,"Hey! No, no- uurgh!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Called it.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
All six aliens together,Hello Rick. Long time no see.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Unity!?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,Rick?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Grandpa?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"After we broke up, I spend some time wandering through space,",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"then I found this world,",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,You mean stealing peoples’ bodies?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Ugh.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"You're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; I've never been good at disappointing Rick.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Well now I'm going to barf. Come on Morty.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Jerry, what are you- what are you doing in here?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ‘cause our weeds are wack, yo.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,I can't?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Well, he doesn't like it.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,What is that supposed to mean?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! He's playing you, shorty.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,What the hell was that?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth," I don't know, let's just leave!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,That is a hatch! Your father put a hatch in my garage!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"You don't know it was him!  Anyway, we’re not supposed to be in here!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"After I become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the Galactic Federation.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh, goody.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,From there I'll have access to countless planets and species.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick," I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Recreational substances were phased out here. There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. People... change.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Especially when I change them. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but... I’ve grown.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Hm, why is that I wonder?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Yes Rick! Yes! Yes!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Oh yeah!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Yes! Yes!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,Look at ‘em go! So coordinated! What’s your problem? They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people's’ bodies are being used! They're a planet of puppets!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I can hear you.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Ugh!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"No, we don't want your dumb balloons. We’re bored. Take us back to Rick.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Now's... not a good time.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Go son go! Go son go! Go son go!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Oh, you know my dad. Once he puts his mind to something...",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,You're spinning this to his credit?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,I'm going down there.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,Jerry!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Okay, you're just making stuff up now.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Oh my god. Oh my god. ,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Oh Rick, it was so bad.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,What's this ‘was’ stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Oh damn.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"It's a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7. Our planet's maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources.  So be nice!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,Unity.  Is it a... bad time? Are all... present lifeforms... assimilated?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,Rick... Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,All bad I hope. ,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Whoa, Jesus Christ!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,Our alliance is beneficial. When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it's only ... be-because...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Oh... Rick, I- I shouldn't...",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town! It- it's for old time's sake.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Uh... Okay, what the hell! We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but...",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Aww, old man Rick can't party with the whole planet?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"I can do whatever you do and more, baby.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,Hrmm...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal-,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Goddamn it, stop.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Wake up people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I can hear you.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Yeah! So you keep saying!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,Summer!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Why do you hate me, Summer?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,...Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"...Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she's a marine biologist.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be... you know, life.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now phisosophers.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Oh, phi- phisosophers?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Philophiluh... phiphophibup...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I'm feeling... urk!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I'm fine!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I’ve met who really sees the big picture.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"You got that right. But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"I can let go! Hey, look! You see that town across the river? Watch this.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Whoa!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Ha ha! Woot!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Whoa! That's not what I meant!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity," It's okay! It's okay, I evacuated! I evacuated the town, look!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Hey! Right here! We’re fine!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick," Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty and Summer,Aah!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Unity, what's happening?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Steven Phillips,Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Gross, no!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Do... all of you remember who you are?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Ron Benson,"...Yeah. My name is Ron Benson. I'm... an electrical engineer. Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race! ",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Okay, that's good! Uh... Don't focus too much on the last part, but...",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Daryl Jefferson,I'm Daryll Jefferson. I'm a landscaper. And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!  The cone-nipple people will rule this world!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Ron Benson,"You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Daryl Jefferson,"What'd you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Alien man,Race war!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Why are you fighting? Can't you see you're all the same?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,I didn't start it! They're the racists! I... I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rioter,"Hey wait, what race are you guys?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty, We’re neither! S-see?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rioter,Hey! These two freaks have no race!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Oh, there's no place like home! There's no place like home! Remember, Summer?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Oh...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"O-oh, yes, yes yes...",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,All the tiny people?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Dorothy, take us away! Take us away!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Hello Summer. Hello Morty.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,It's okay! You're safe now.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,U-Unity?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Yes.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of... a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong! I'm having fun with your grandpa! Lost a little control. Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be... running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! It's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Um... should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk! Wooohoooo!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Jerry, stop! Please, okay, we weren't even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this-",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! It's a monster! He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He's probably harvesting this creature's organs!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,He's probably racing to cure its space aids!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,He's going to eat it!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,He's protecting it!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Both,Shut up!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Unity! This place is a mess!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Oh, it's cool! The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.  Oh my god! I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. Oh, I'll never make it! Ah, I'll push it to next week.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Unity, could you get Rick out here please?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,He's... unavailable! He's-,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I don't think he wants to be-,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer, Grandpa Rick!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty, Rick! Rick!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer, I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,What the hell... is your problem?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Grandpa, we need to go home! Now!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Fine, geez!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,See ya!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"Uh, Rick? I think we should all go.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Oh my god  you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,What?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"This isn't healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,You and Unity are like... like... leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I'm just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We’re... really just having a good time. Karen?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Thanks, Todd. Up next: Are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We'll tell you how you can really know for sure!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,I think you two are a little outnumbered.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us... because you love us?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,What? Dumb. Bye.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Morty,"But Rick, Summer's just-",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here... uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,"Take care of yourself, Unity.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,You're the worst!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,No! You're the worst! You don't support this family!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,All you care about is yourself!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"...but you're unsupportable! Because it's never enough, Jerry!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,It will never be enough support to satisfy you! And you don't even know what it's like...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,...to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling...,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,"And why? Because you're the child, Beth. You, not me, you!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Jerry,Aaah!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,Oh my god!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth and Jerry,Aah!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,"Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I'd laugh but I'm biologically incapable, that's how alien I am! And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck?!? So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I'm sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam, out!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,You know what? I'm taking this.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,How do you- what is this?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Blim Blam,"Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Aaah!  Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ‘em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ‘em all do it on the table! I can’t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha!  Alright, I’m bored.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? I feel bad that they-",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,Never.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Never! Back in a flash.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Hey Une! You got any more-,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but... it clearly means I have a problem with myself.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Unity,"But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S. I don't know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. You might want to get checked.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Hey.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,"Dad...  I... um... Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair... and your alien prisoner. And... he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Okay.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beth,...Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,No. It's your house.,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Summer,Grandpa Rick! What happened... with Unity?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It's not cool. Fun's fun but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,Unity! Unity! Unity!,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,How can I assist you?,2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"I wanna talk to  Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Beta-7,"You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you.",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
Rick,"I know your game, Beta-7, I’ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!",2,3,Auto Erotic Assimilation
