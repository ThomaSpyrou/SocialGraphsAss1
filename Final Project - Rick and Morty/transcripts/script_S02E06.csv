Morty,"Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Yeah, I'm pretty jealous.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,Shut up! ,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,W-whoa!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Oh great.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,Uhm. Go inside what?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,Wait! You can't leave me here!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Thinner Man,Uaghuu. Ugh. Uh. Oh God! I can't feel my legs! Help! He-elp!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship,Summer is safe.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,I don't feel safe.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship,Confirmed.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Thinner Man,Oh God help me! Help me! help me please! You can help me.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,Oh man. Where are we Rick?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Morty, remember eight seconds ago when -burp- when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, ""Go inside what?"" And I said, ""The battery""? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, ""Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is.""",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"W-w-w-whoa, people? ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"It's time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,Whoa!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Anchor,"It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,What? Why?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Obviously  you really  know nothing about car repair.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Greetings!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means ""Peace among worlds."" How hilarious is that?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,"Rick, our alien friend.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,"That's correct.  We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick, I would love to see it.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President, you.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,What did you say to me?!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,""" you."" Y-you told me it means ""much obliged"".",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,"No, no, no. Blow me.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,"Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,"Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien...",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Ohhhh, snap!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Listen to me, you arrogant little--",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President," R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick, Dumb  name.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,Excuse me?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick," Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,This isn't a  chocolate factory. I don't have time.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Mr.President,Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,Whoa-oh!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,What?!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then--",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick," Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Rick, a word?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,What the hell was that?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"I know. ""Eek barba dirkle""? That's a pretty  up ""ooh-la-la"".",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Wh-wh-why are you making that face? ,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,Holy Shit!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world. ,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"Places, please. We're about to land.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Teenyverse President,All of them. That's their job.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Teenyverse President,How do you know about that? It's top secret.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.  Crank it. I told them this means ""Peace among worlds"". How hilarious is that?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Rick,"Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Kyle,"It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is--",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick, It's show time.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically-- This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick," Told you, Zeep.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Kyle,"Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,What? ,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Kyle,Are they not really aliens?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Kyle,"So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,I made you!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty," Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know?

Morty,"Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. ",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,That's what you used my universe for? To run your car?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,You crafty son of a--,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Zeep,I didn't ask to be born!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Army General,"Go, go, go!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,"Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship,"I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,Correct.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship,You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,"If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship, Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Summer,"You know you're kind of a dick, right?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Ship,"My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff. That's you. That's how you talk.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Hey, that's my deer!",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,Aaaaaaah!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Raah!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,I hope your God is as big a dick as you.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,You're here because you created someone smarter than you.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Morty,Kalo kada sha la.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,That is pretty gay.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Morty,"This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop.

Zeep,"If this works, drinks are on me.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy

Morty,Yes! You did it! Yes!,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Hey, uh, how about that drink?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,"Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,"Is our wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?",2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Zeep,It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
Rick,You know how long a second can take in a microverse?,2,6,The Ricks Must Be Crazy
