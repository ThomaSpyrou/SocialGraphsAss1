Morty,"Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"It's called ""carpe diem"", Morty. Look it up.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I'm ready when you a--,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Bitch, I was ready yest--",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,"Bye, sweetie.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Well, I-I better--",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Sure. Sounds important.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,"If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Okay.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Wind, Loser...,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,What? Hello?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,They all have mohawks!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mohawk Guy,Ah!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #1,Light them up.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mohawk Guy,Ahh!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Give me your flask!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Holy shit, Summer for the win!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Here we go.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Isotope 322.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Summer!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Hold on. I want to try something.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Colossus,Your blood will be my lotion.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Whoa. That was cool.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Colossus,"Kill me, please.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Okay, but not because you told me to.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Summer!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Okay, getting darker.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Jesus Christ. Summer!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Aw, come on.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,What is your deal lately?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer, Okay.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,What?!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Sounds good. Stay hydrated.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Lunch server,Bicep or quadricep?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Uh...  bicep.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty," Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"No. Okay, I'll level with you.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Isotope 322.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Summer just ran off with strangers that have ""Death"" in their name, and the rest of their name was ""Stalkers""!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the ""F"" out of ""H""!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"""Distract""? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be...",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #2,"Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #3," Ooh, burn!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Ugh! Hey!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,I-I didn't do that!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Ooh! Help! Help!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #4,"Oh, sweet, man!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,"And so it begins, my pretties!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"After the ""boom-boom"", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Jesus Christ, did the ""boomy-booms"" blow up all your ""wordy-word books""?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,You mean dictionaries?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Want to piss on it?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Get out of my head.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Okay, no more!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,And he wants more!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"No, I don't!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Someone, make this stop!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Morty.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty," Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything! Hemorrhage: This family does.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Leave?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I'm not leaving.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"There is no ""leave"". We are united, or we are enemies.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #5,"Hey, the Green Rock is gone!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #6," Oh, no!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,When did I lose control here?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"All right, you know what? Fuck it!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Blue Footprint Guy,My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Nope, regular blood.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Dad?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Hi, sweetie.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Where are the kids?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Not panicked. At all.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Not a mistake, no!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,What? Wait a minute.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,"What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Ha!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,It can't be. It can't be!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,I was just following orders --,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Whoa, whoa!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,-- I was just following orders!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Death Stalker #7,Ahh!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Soldier,I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"This isn't over, is it?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Ugh!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"What about the weird guys on leashes, then?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,They're more like interns.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Cool, cool.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Sorry.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,It's okay.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Can I see?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,No one has seen my true face and lived.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Hmm?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,You hate it.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of ""mustache,"" in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase ""hat on a hat""?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,I can shave it.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemmorhage,"Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, ""Well, why not get rid of this?"" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here  wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because --",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Leash Man,"Hey, I'm doing a coffee run -- Never mind.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,I am Summer.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Summer, state your deal.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,"My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Morty?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,All right.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,It's dinnertime.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
"MS, MR, and Rick, in unison",No problem.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,"Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"Uh, okay, weirdo. ",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"How's school, Morty?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- ""staying together for the kids."" End quote mode.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"""Quote mode"". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,"All I know is, totally, you look great.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It's crazy.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,So happy.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,I don't know why I'm crying. It's not --,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Well, try crying 15% less?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,"Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,I have to call Jerry.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,Your feelings are coming from a --,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti --",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Slaveowner,"Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer --",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Ahh! Oh, gee!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Slaveowner,"Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Slaveowner,"Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Slaveowner,"I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Slaveowner,"Aw, fuck!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Rick?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Yeah, well, too late.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,I want you and your sister to come home.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Wait. Can you stay to show us more?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Ugh. Goddamn it.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,"Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli's Girlfriend,"Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Oh, congratulations, guys.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,"Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I got it.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli's Girlfriend,She's a piece of work.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Eli,"They both are, right?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I'm home.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Hey, babe.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Ah, Summer's home.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"Hey, there she is!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,Blood Dome playoffs.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,I still don't!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Ohh! Ding, ding, ding!",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Uh, we should go to the garage.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,"Oh, my God.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,Uh-huh.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage,La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,Coolsies.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Hemorrhage, Noooooooooo!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Downbeat!,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Rick,I enjoy this game.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Summer,"We will return, possibly in different clothing.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,Why do we have to go into the garage?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Rick,You know  it is  required.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,"I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,What the fuck?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Mechanical Morty,Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,What the hell just happened?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Rick,"What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, ""Downbeat""? No, thank you.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,Sure.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,Thanks.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"Morty, are you okay?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,"You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Beth,"Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Morty,What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Summer.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Thanks.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,"I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Cool.,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Summer,"So lots of hookers outside, huh?",3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Is that what they are?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Jerry,Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check?,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
Wind, ...loser...,3,2,Rickmancing the Stone
