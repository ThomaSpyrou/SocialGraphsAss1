Beth,You two are hungry.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Big day.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,We're gonna kill God.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,Come again?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Christian God is real, he's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill him.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Mob style.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Whack his ass.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Can I kill God?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick," Fuck off, Summer.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty," Pfft, as if!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Beth, do you hear this?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Sweetie, don't get all worked up before your job interview.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Job interview?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Yes, is that so hard to believe?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Actually, yeah. Something's off.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,No!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Shit!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,"Hunt me, hunt me, somebody hunt me!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Don't hunt him to completion!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,Hunt me! ,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Oh. Shit. Everyone start packing, no time to explain.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,Rick?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Dad? What's wrong?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Someone just killed a decoy family.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,You made clones of us?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Decoys, Morty. Very different.  Very different, sweetie.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Different h-ow! ,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Yeah, dad. Different h-ow?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,But why does he always want to be hunted?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Jerry–,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"It's not important right now, dad!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,So thankful this is my Saturday.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,Why was he in that cryopod?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Well, I don't see any stakes at all.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Ah, shit!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Guess we'll just be saying ""ciao bella"" to our deposit, then!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Decoy family?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Is this why you wanted to get out of town?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you.  Well, that's a lie. Huh.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,So someone out there is trying to kill us?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Someone's always trying to kill us. That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and– take bullets meant for us. Shit.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,Ahhh! No!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Ah, shit. Decoy family.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,I think dad was still outside. What's a decoy family?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Oh, cool!",5,2,Mortyplicity
TV,We now return to When Wolf.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Yeah, I never thought of the ""were"" in ""werewolf"" like ""who, what, when and where!"" Clever wordplay!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Dracula,When Wolf!,5,2,Mortyplicity
When Wolf,Dracula! You know why I'm here.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Dracula,"I'm safe here, Ian! Christianity hasn't been invented yet, crosses are just baby t's to me now! I got out. Please, don't invite me back in.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20's and invest in the stock market, but then eat people.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Yeah.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it– whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Decoy family? You made more clones?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Do you just get hard creating sentient life?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Actually, I get hard protecting my family!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Ew.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Ugh, gross!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelgängers. Cool deal.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"The decoys are harmless, Beth.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,So they think they're us?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,That's the deal.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"How do you know we're not decoys?  Oh my god, we're decoys.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,What do I do?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I'm real, you have to help me, I'd never joke about this.  There's a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,What?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Morty, please, I'm begging you!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,I'm not looking at your ass!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it!  Just tell me if I'm real!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Morty, do it!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Gross!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Dad!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Why did I get punished?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"A, decoys don't build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Fuck off.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Kind of expected a funnier password.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,I didn't plan on showing them off.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty," Damn, like Westworld!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Westworld. But don't fuck them.  Summer!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an exact replica?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Shit.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"You know you can use tissues, right?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,I can't finish without it.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,So you do know what a happy family looks like.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,I know what a fake one looks like.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Uh, Rick?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick, What?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Did you use this house to make decoys, too?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick," What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to–  okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids.  Isolate head at normal processing.  What the fuck do you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Wait, how do you—oh god, Summer was right.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Everyone in the car.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,You said decoys didn't make decoys.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"And usually, they don't, but again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless.  Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Terminate? They're alive, dad!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than Blade Runner.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,I still think we're decoys.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,You just want an excuse to stop trying.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Yeah, and?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry," Oooh, there's a handsome fellow!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Uh-oh.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,I thought you made them harmless.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,I don't remember making this one. ,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Jerry,"Oh, hi, Rick! Family...me...? Hey, when did you all leave?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Jerry,Hmm?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it's making you loopy! Happy analysis mode! ",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Jerry,"Happy analysis mode to you, too!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Shit, you think I'm a decoy?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,How do you know about the decoys?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,They were my idea!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Jerry," Well, now I know you're pranking me.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8 equals sign equals sign capital ""d"".",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Hide.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,What?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Hide!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Morty,"Wow, like Ex Machina!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Ex Machina. But don't fuck them. Summer!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Summer,"Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,So you do know what a loving family looks like.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"A simulated one, yes.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Why are we hiding?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,But we're not decoys!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Sure, tell him that.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Morty,"Rick, did you make decoys here, too?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Morty, for what reason could I have for...what the– isolate head at normal processing!  You dumb asshole, you made decoys?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Again, they were my idea. Wait, what happened to the other guy?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,Other guy?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,"Wait, that means I'm a decoy. Fucking Summer.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,Check the closets.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,They've gone rogue!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Killer decoys!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,Take out the decoys!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,Shit! Someone put a gun in my teeth!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,"Stop shooting, dad! They're us, we don't have to fight them!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Classic prisoner's dilemma, Beth. I'm a cool guy, I, you know, I can talk it out. But that asshole–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Me? You decoy piece of shit. You're the one that shot first!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"We can work this out, just stop trying to kill each other!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way, with one of us accepting we're a decoy.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"And once he knows he's a decoy, he know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he's him.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Pretty perceptive, for a decoy.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Do we have to do this?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Oof.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,We rush them on three. Ready?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Morty,"I don't want to kill us, Rick!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"It's them or us, Morty. I don't trust me. Do you trust you?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Morty,Yes?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,Freak.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Before you say anything, they were already killing each other.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Well, you could've done something.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"Sorry, what's happening?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"I need an explainer, too.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Yeah, I'm pretty much behind on this one.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Car, can I get a whiteboard?  When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Say decoy again.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Fuck you.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Well, how do we stop it?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander rules now.  Really? 1986? ""There can be only one?"" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays ""the spaniard"" but does nothing about his accent.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess, nobody else with our face and memories has to die.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,You're helping us fix this. We're taking out the squids.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,"I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Engage in B stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,This costume smells like ass!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"God, there's no pleasing you!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"It's really bad, Rick.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Did you let a gym coach break it in?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,Why are we wearing these?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Which we won't.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth," Oh my god! You are, aren't you? You're worried you might be fake!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else's squid costumes.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"There's one.  Hey, what're they mad at you for, anyway?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick's too big, the list goes on and on.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let's loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Huh.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids...",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Well, I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Honestly, probably for the best.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick," Man, I'm good.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Dad!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Oh, shit. One of mine.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Where are we going?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,That licks.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Oh, maybe now you'll empathize with the decoys you're killing!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Wait, shhh. It's too quiet.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,You skipped quiet.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Yeah, but you're supposed to say–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,Where are we? Where's Rick?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"He's right here, Morty!  Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look...different?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry," Oh, god!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty," Ugh, it stinks!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"Yes, recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"You see, Ricks, they get lazy. There's always a shitty decoy towards the end. But those decoys made decoys too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line...there be monsters.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,"Ugh, we get it, you're ugly and mad about it.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry, Rick!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer, Grandpa!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Kill me... if I ever get this arch.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"Hush, little decoy. Can't kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,You know what? You're a monster.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"I'm your father! At least, I can look more like him once I harvest all this yummy skin.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,This guy's really into skin.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,It's not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Beth,"Will I beautiful again, daddy?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,"Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Scarecrow Rick,What the–,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Rick,Help the others!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,Why are you helping us?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Rick,Because we're all in this together. Come on! There's a place we can go!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Jerry,"Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Summer,Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Morty,"Also, y'know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Jerry,Excuse me for wanting to live.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Beth,"Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To our cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Summer,Whatever.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Summer,Asshole!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Beth,"We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god, and drive to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,I don't know if that's accurate.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Rick,Sounds extreme.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Beth,But that violence ends today!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Jerry,What about the squids?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Beth, The squids are decoys!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Summer, There were no squids!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Other Decoy Summer,The squids are decoys who realized they're decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Other Decoy Jerry,"Yeah, it is a lot.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Beth,We cannot let confusion divide us!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Decoy Morty,"Squids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Rick,"Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Glockenspiel Jerry,"I'm sorry, I didn't ask for this! I just wanna live! But there's only so much varnish! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,How long before the other decoys find us?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,I'm just glad we're living to the fullest with the time we have left.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer," Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Jerry? Bucket list?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Jerry,I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,Nope! Morty?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,"Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"You're so mean today! I'm your dad, you like having me around!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Beth,You keep putting us in danger!,5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a Star Fox boss season four callback? Make it flashy?",5,2,Mortyplicity
House,"You got it, babe.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick," Let's go, you little bitch.  It's showtime.  Get centered.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter!  I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck, a beacon! That's a great idea! He's got home turf,  a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!""  And now you're thinking ""shit, that's totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake!  I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass.""  Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I'm gonna loop it. Why is it–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Steve,"Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the American Southwest.",5,2,Mortyplicity
The President,"Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Steve,"Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral collage is–",5,2,Mortyplicity
The President,"To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve. I have the internet too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette and bring me a Diet Coke.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,"Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Morty,"We might be decoys, huh.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Rick,One way to find out.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Looks like it's calming down. You wanna get in one more ""I told you so"" about synthetic life or whatever this week's theme is?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,"Oh, fuck you.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick, Whoa.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,"No, you don't get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you're terrified of losing either!",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,Shit.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,Yeah.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Look, Beth, I might not be the real Rick. But even if I'm not, he made me, or the me that made me. Which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that. A version of Rick who's sorry. I'm sorry about the clone thing, too. I love you.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,"Thanks, dad.I love you, too. You really think we're decoys?",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Eh. Who cares? We'll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon, this was gonna take weeks.  Alright, let's mop up.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Beth,Finally.,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I'm not sure it helped, but I'm glad we tried it.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Morty,We're losing the costumes?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Summer,"Thank god, this decoy outfit smells like ass.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Fuck you, Summer.",5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Rick,"Shit, that guy's awesome. Okay, listen, he might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens–",5,2,Mortyplicity
Summer,Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?,5,2,Mortyplicity
Second Summer,"You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise.",5,2,Mortyplicity
