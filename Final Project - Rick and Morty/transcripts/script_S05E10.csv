Owl 3,He’s only one man!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,With the power of a thousand crows!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Owl 3,Good luck.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Owl 2,"Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care? What’s the point?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Here’s two.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Haha, yeah, cool.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Morty?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you’re like, looking like, into crows. Still.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty. Morty, two crows. It’s good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn’t like—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,It’s just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crow-horse,Crow-horse. Crow-horse. Crow-horse.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,"Caw, caw, caw.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Okay. It looks like— it looks like they’re leading you to a thing.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Take care, Morty.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"You-you too. U-uh I’m doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Ahem. I’m lookin’ for Crowscare. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Rick!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Morty?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Pussifer,Wood?!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Pussifer,Gahhh!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Th-that’s how long it’s been, Rick.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Do you have a rum and coke?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Waiter,"What are you, twenty?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Time be going by, don’t she?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,That’s your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,I feel okay.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Well-well, what about me?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Woah. Excuse us boys, you don’t wanna be here for this.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,Caw.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"I thought if I gave you enough space, you’d outgrow this phase.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Waiter,"Here’s your drink, poser.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer’s a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Morty, what we had wasn’t healthy.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"I hope that’s not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,"Caw, caw, caw.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"Don’t defend him to me, I don’t even get what you see in him.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,"Caw, caw.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"You’re right, we should be enjoying the time we have together.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,Crow Rick!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,Caw.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"Oh, I know what this must look like but—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,"Caw, caw, caw.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"What do you mean, ‘using me as a rebound’?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,Caw.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could’ve been worse. At least ‘adventuring’ was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it’s not a real breakup.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other’s bodies.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"What?! Eugh, no!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"Sounds like the man’s asking for proof! Let’s show him, fellas!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Two crows,"Caw, caw, caw.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crowscare,"Ah, aah.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,I’m giving you free will. Yah!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Crow-horse,Submit to Crow-horse!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Whoops.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,R-rick?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Wubba lubba dub dub! I’m back, pal!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Jerry,"Morty, who’s at the door?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell’s going on here?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"See, um th-the thing is, uh—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Beth,"Can you please make Morty fourteen again, dad? This is ridiculous.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I’m done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I’m ready to make this work.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Let’s just hit the reset button.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Beth,"Well no, honey, not a reset, okay? Tell your grandpa that you’re worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"I refuse to do that, I’m desperate to get back together.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Jerry,Just like his old man.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Don’t worry honey, that’s just Morty’s middle age talking. He’ll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Summer,"Uh, I’d like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I’d rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Andy,"Hi! I’m the Citadel’s new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn’t be home without Ricks aaand-ey Mortys!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Dumb.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Oof, what happened to this place?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,There’s a Morty president now.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Ah, that’s cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,They made it Glendale.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Goddamn you are cantankerous.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Even pooping hurts now.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Employee Morty,"Okay, so… we’ve got a standard Morty that’s been aged to forty.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Can you reverse it?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Employee Morty,"Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle and graft its ends back together.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Th-th-that sounds really violent.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"It’s not a literal bone, Morty.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Oh, Okay.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Employee Morty,"Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Toddler Morty 1,I like crayons.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Toddler Morty 2,Girls are gross.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,I-I-I think I feel like myself again.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin’s all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Employee Morty,"Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Wait, what? I ain’t payin’ to store twenty-six years.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Employee Morty,"Well, then you’re taking it with you.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Twenty-Six Year Old Morty,I’m almost ready to sell out.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Alright, what’s disposal cost?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Twenty-Six Year Old Morty,S-something unfair’s happening!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Deformed Morty,There’s no escape! No escape!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Twenty-Six Year Old Morty,"Let me help you, this is not a good look!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Oh boy.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Hey, they shot me!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Police Morty,You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Deformed Morty,Listen to me!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Police Morty,Drop the gun!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Deformed Morty,"Death is coming for us all, and the Citadel is a weapon of mass destruc—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Woof. You’re about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let’s get out of here before this gets political.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Twenty-Six Year Old Morty,U-uh. Was I influential?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Twenty-Six Year Old Morty,Tight. Uh.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Ugh. Too late.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Secret Service Rick,C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Woah! S-seriously?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,You know I destroyed this place?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Secret Service Rick,"You’ve been pardoned for that, sir.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Rick, let’s have dinner with the Morty president.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he’s evil, we’re gone.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,I don’t know. Tastes pretty good.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Sorry I’m late. Never really ends around here.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"And I hate ‘em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that’s a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Geez, wouldn’t dream of it. But it’s amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,There’s the reveal. Let’s dance.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Ha, geez.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He’s being really nice.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,All politicians are nice.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"He’s a hot bag of peanuts, isn’t he?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"We’ve been through a lot, a-and he does not like—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Serialized drama.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Wait, what?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That’s why you got deformed Mortys comin’ up through the sewer lines talking about ‘hope’ and ‘change’.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Fair enough.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Good clap-back, Rick. What’s the deal with that, Mr. P?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Alright, time to go Morty.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,I wanna know what he’s talking about.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Yeah, you’ve come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Literally ten? Because now it would be six.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Oh, I’m fine with that. Make it two… one. Like I said, would’ve been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure…",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,You can’t scan an entire brain over appetizers.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,You probably don’t remember.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick Stan Lee,"Check out season one, episode nine, Rickheads. Excel-uurp-cior!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Evil Rick.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,We kicked his ass.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Looks complete. I was afraid I’d have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I’m sorry, Rick.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I’d hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can’t help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I’m sure you don’t know how far they’ve gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He’s an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he’s attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we’re with him. This is why we’re alive.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn’t true!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,It isn’t the whole truth.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Liar!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Liar.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,It’s complicated!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,I’m not busy!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I’m basically Inspector Gadget.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Uh oh.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"It’s okay, he’s free to go. He’s the Rickest Rick. We’ll never see him again.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Yeah.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Holy shit!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"I only know one man that ever hacked my Portal Gun, and it turned out it was evil you.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Yay. He’s all caught up.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Wait! Hold it, hold it!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Wh-who’s that?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Time for Big Boy. Duck!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Does he like it?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"He’s a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Yoink!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"You can’t outrun your past, Rick.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Loudspeaker system,"Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick D716,"In uncertain times like these, I think it’s important for me to say: Eat shit, fuck you! The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don’t care— oh god oh fuck no, oh—",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
'Rick D716-B,And I’d just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"What’s happening, Rick?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"He hacked the entire city’s portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,What do you think he needed from your brain?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"I assume schematics for the Citadel’s Dimensional Drive. If he’s gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,What is the Central Finite Curve?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Or not.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Can’t you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We’re back to simple adventures.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,It’s not a new leaf until you tell me everything.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Morty, we really don’t have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"No, I-I don’t trust you. I-I-I don’t wanna do this anymore if I’m not gonna get straight answers from you.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Woah. Dead wife?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Of course that’s the case. In their minds, they’re the underdog.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,And that’s how they justify this.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Morty, I’m not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it’s part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves. ‘Oh, it’s so hard to be a genius. Couldn’t you just die?’",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Well what are you doin’ about it?,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"Jack shit. I’m leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he’s the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"And I’m leaving it. That’s what makes me ‘evil’, being sick of him. If you’ve ever been sick of him, you’ve been evil too.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,"There you go, kid. Now you’re Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Orange Afro Rick,"Don’t worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Orange Afro Morty,"Doesn’t that still mean, like, death?",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Orange Afro Rick,"Sure, but the joke’s on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Oh my fucking god!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Come on Morty, we gotta go!",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,Woah!,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,You can come if you want.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,Don’t blame me if you don’t.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that’s the best deal on the table. I-I don’t have a real plan.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Thanks, pal. I-I’m glad you ignored my advice.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
President Morty,It’s just as well. I lied. That second seat’s a toilet.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Morty,"Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let’s go.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Rick,"Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,"Woo-wee. Evil Morty. That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there’s an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need ‘im. Cuz, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo eee.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,"I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,But then I guess I stopped.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,"Cuz I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,"Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day , ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,Wish I didn’t do that.,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,"Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don’t know, maybe you should try it.",5,10,Rickmurai Jack
Mr. Poopybutthole,We don’t have as much time as we think. Ooo eee. ,5,10,Rickmurai Jack
